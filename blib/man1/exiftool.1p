when one is expected.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
A command-line interface to Image::ExifTool, used for
reading and writing meta information in a variety of file types.  \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR is
one or more source file names, directory names, or \f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR for the standard
input.  Metadata is read from source files and printed in readable form to
the console (or written to output text files with \fB\-w\fR).
.PP
To write or delete metadata, tag values are assigned using
\&\-\fI\s-1TAG\s0\fR=[\fI\s-1VALUE\s0\fR], and/or the \fB\-geotag\fR, \fB\-csv=\fR or \fB\-json=\fR options. 
To copy or move metadata, the \fB\-tagsFromFile\fR feature is used.  By default
the original files are preserved with \f(CW\*(C`_original\*(C'\fR appended to their names
\&\*(-- be sure to verify that the new files are \s-1OK\s0 before erasing the originals.
Once in write mode, exiftool will ignore any read-specific options.
.PP
Note:  If \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR is a directory name then only supported file types in the
directory are processed (in write mode only writable types are processed).
However, files may be specified by name, or the \fB\-ext\fR option may be used
to force processing of files with any extension.  Hidden files in the
directory are also processed.  Adding the \fB\-r\fR option causes subdirectories
to be processed recursively, but subdirectories with names beginning with
\&\*(L".\*(R" are skipped unless \fB\-r.\fR is used.
.PP
Below is a list of file types and meta information formats currently
supported by ExifTool (r = read, w = write, c = create):

Case is not significant for any command-line option (including tag and group
names), except for single-character options when the corresponding
upper-case option exists.  Many single-character options have equivalent
long-name versions (shown in brackets), and some options have inverses which
are invoked with a leading double-dash.  Unrecognized options are
interpreted as tag names (for this reason, multiple single-character options
may \s-1NOT\s0 be combined into one argument).  Contrary to standard practice,
options may appear after source file names on the exiftool command line.

family.
.Sp
A special tag name of \f(CW\*(C`All\*(C'\fR may be used to indicate all meta information
(ie. \fB\-All\fR).  This is particularly useful when a group name is specified
to extract all information in a group (but beware that unless the \fB\-a\fR
option is also used, some tags in the group may be suppressed by same-named
tags in other groups).  The wildcard characters \f(CW\*(C`?\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR may be used in
a tag name to match any single character and zero or more characters
respectively. These may not be used in a group name, with the exception that
a group name of \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR (or \f(CW\*(C`All\*(C'\fR) may be used to extract all instances of a
tag (as if \fB\-a\fR was used).  Note that arguments containing wildcards must
be quoted on the command line of most systems to prevent shell globbing.
.Sp
A \f(CW\*(C`#\*(C'\fR may be appended to the tag name to disable the print conversion on a
per-tag basis (see the \fB\-n\fR option).  This may also be used when writing or
copying tags.
.Sp
If no tags are specified, all available information is extracted (as if
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-All\*(C'\fR had been specified).
.Sp
Note:  Descriptions, not tag names, are shown by default when extracting
information.  Use the \fB\-s\fR option to see the tag names instead.
.IP "\fB\-\-\fR\fI\s-1TAG\s0\fR" 5
.IX Item "--TAG"
Exclude specified tag from extracted information.  Same as the \fB\-x\fR option.
Group names and wildcards are permitted as described above for \fB\-TAG\fR. 
Once excluded from the output, a tag may not be re-included by a subsequent
option.  May also be used following a \fB\-tagsFromFile\fR option to exclude
tags from being copied (when redirecting to another tag, it is the source
tag that should be excluded), or to exclude groups from being deleted when
deleting all information (eg. \f(CW\*(C`\-all= \-\-exif:all\*(C'\fR deletes all but \s-1EXIF\s0
information).  But note that this will not exclude individual tags from a
group delete (unless a family 2 group is specified, see note 4 below).
Instead, individual tags may be recovered using the \fB\-tagsFromFile\fR option
(eg. \f(CW\*(C`\-all= \-tagsfromfile @ \-artist\*(C'\fR).
.Sp
To speed processing when reading \s-1XMP,\s0 exclusions in \s-1XMP\s0 groups also bypass
processing of the corresponding \s-1XMP\s0 property and any contained properties.
For example, \f(CW\*(C`\-\-xmp\-crs:all\*(C'\fR may speed processing significantly in cases
where a large number of XMP-crs tags exist.  To use this feature to bypass
processing of a specific \s-1XMP\s0 property, the property name must be used
instead of the ExifTool tag name (eg. \f(CW\*(C`\-\-xmp\-crs:dabs\*(C'\fR).  Also, \f(CW\*(C`XMP\-all\*(C'\fR
may be used to to indicate any \s-1XMP\s0 namespace (eg. \f(CW\*(C`\-\-xmp\-all:dabs\*(C'\fR).

Write a new value for the specified tag (eg. \f(CW\*(C`\-comment=wow\*(C'\fR), or delete the

add or remove existing entries from a list, or to shift date/time values
(see Image::ExifTool::Shift.pl and note 6 below
for more details).  \f(CW\*(C`+=\*(C'\fR may also be used to increment numerical values (or
decrement if \fI\s-1VALUE\s0\fR is negative), and \f(CW\*(C`\-=\*(C'\fR may be used to conditionally
delete or replace a tag (see \*(L"\s-1WRITING EXAMPLES\*(R"\s0 for examples).  \f(CW\*(C`^=\*(C'\fR is
used to write an empty string instead of deleting the tag when no \fI\s-1VALUE\s0\fR
is given, but otherwise it is equivalent to \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR, but note that the caret
must be quoted on the Windows command line.
.Sp
\&\fI\s-1TAG\s0\fR may contain one or more leading family 0, 1, 2 or 7 group names,
prefixed by optional family numbers, and separated colons.  If no group name
is specified, the tag is created in the preferred group, and updated in any
other location where a same-named tag already exists.  The preferred group
in \s-1JPEG\s0 and TIFF-format images is the first group in the following list
where \fI\s-1TAG\s0\fR is valid: 1) \s-1EXIF, 2\s0) \s-1IPTC, 3\s0) \s-1XMP.\s0
.Sp
The wildcards \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`?\*(C'\fR may be used in tag names to assign the same
value to multiple tags.  When specified with wildcards, \*(L"Unsafe\*(R" tags are
not written.  A tag name of \f(CW\*(C`All\*(C'\fR is equivalent to \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR (except that it
doesn't require quoting, while arguments with wildcards do on systems with
shell globbing), and is often used when deleting all metadata (ie. \f(CW\*(C`\-All=\*(C'\fR)
or an entire group (eg. \f(CW\*(C`\-XMP\-dc:All=\*(C'\fR, see note 4 below).  Note that not
all groups are deletable, and that the \s-1JPEG APP14\s0 \*(L"Adobe\*(R" group is not
removed by default with \f(CW\*(C`\-All=\*(C'\fR because it may affect the appearance of the
image.  However, color space information is removed, so the colors may be
affected (but this may be avoided by copying back the tags defined by the
ColorSpaceTags shortcut).  Use the \fB\-listd\fR option for a complete list of
deletable groups, and see note 5 below regarding the \*(L"\s-1APP\*(R"\s0 groups.  Also,
within an image some groups may be contained within others, and these groups
are removed if the containing group is deleted:

Notes:
.Sp
1) \fBMany tag values may be assigned in a single command\fR.  If two
assignments affect the same tag, the latter takes precedence (except for
list-type tags, for which both values are written).
.Sp
2) In general, MakerNotes tags are considered \*(L"Permanent\*(R", and may be edited
but not created or deleted individually.  This avoids many potential
problems, including the inevitable compatibility problems with \s-1OEM\s0 software
which may be very inflexible about the information it expects to find in the
maker notes.
.Sp
3) Changes to \s-1PDF\s0 files by ExifTool are reversible (by deleting the update
with \f(CW\*(C`\-PDF\-update:all=\*(C'\fR) because the original information is never actually
deleted from the file.  So ExifTool alone may not be used to securely edit
metadata in \s-1PDF\s0 files.
.Sp
4) Specifying \f(CW\*(C`\-GROUP:all=\*(C'\fR deletes the entire group as a block only if a
single family 0 or 1 group is specified.  Otherwise all deletable tags in
the specified group(s) are removed individually, and in this case is it
possible to exclude individual tags from a mass delete.  For example,
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-time:all \-\-Exif:Time:All\*(C'\fR removes all deletable Time tags except those in
the \s-1EXIF.\s0  This difference also applies if family 2 is specified when
deleting all groups.  For example, \f(CW\*(C`\-2all:all=\*(C'\fR deletes tags individually,
while \f(CW\*(C`\-all:all=\*(C'\fR deletes entire blocks.
.Sp
5) The \*(L"\s-1APP\*(R"\s0 group names (\*(L"\s-1APP0\*(R"\s0 through \*(L"\s-1APP15\*(R"\s0) are used to delete \s-1JPEG\s0
application segments which are not associated with another deletable group. 
For example, specifying \f(CW\*(C`\-APP14:All=\*(C'\fR will \s-1NOT\s0 delete the \s-1APP14\s0 \*(L"Adobe\*(R"
segment because this is accomplished with \f(CW\*(C`\-Adobe:All\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
6) When shifting a value, the shift is applied to the original value of the
tag, overriding any other values previously assigned to the tag on the same
command line.  To shift a date/time value and copy it to another tag in the
same operation, use the \fB\-globalTimeShift\fR option.
.Sp
Special feature:  Integer values may be specified in hexadecimal with a
leading \f(CW\*(C`0x\*(C'\fR, and simple rational values may be specified as fractions.
.IP "\fB\-\fR\fI\s-1TAG\s0\fR<=\fI\s-1DATFILE\s0\fR or \fB\-\fR\fI\s-1TAG\s0\fR<=\fI\s-1FMT\s0\fR" 5
.IX Item "-TAG<=DATFILE or -TAG<=FMT"
Set the value of a tag from the contents of file \fI\s-1DATFILE\s0\fR.  The file name
may also be given by a \fI\s-1FMT\s0\fR string where \f(CW%d\fR, \f(CW%f\fR and \f(CW%e\fR represent the
directory, file name and extension of the original \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR (see the \fB\-w\fR
option for more details).  Note that quotes are required around this
argument to prevent shell redirection since it contains a \f(CW\*(C`<\*(C'\fR symbol.
If \fI\s-1DATFILE\s0\fR/\fI\s-1FMT\s0\fR is not provided, the effect is the same as \f(CW\*(C`\-TAG=\*(C'\fR,
and the tag is simply deleted.  \f(CW\*(C`+<=\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-<=\*(C'\fR may also be used to
add or delete specific list entries, or to shift date/time values.
.IP "\fB\-tagsFromFile\fR \fI\s-1SRCFILE\s0\fR or \fI\s-1FMT\s0\fR" 5
.IX Item "-tagsFromFile SRCFILE or FMT"
Copy tag values from \fI\s-1SRCFILE\s0\fR to \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR.  Tag names on the command line
after this option specify the tags to be copied, or excluded from the copy.
Wildcards are permitted in these tag names.  If no tags are specified, then
all possible tags (see note 1 below) from the source file are copied to
same-named tags in the preferred location of the output file (the same as
specifying \f(CW\*(C`\-all\*(C'\fR).  More than one \fB\-tagsFromFile\fR option may be used to
copy tags from multiple files.
.Sp
By default, this option will update any existing and writable same-named
tags in the output \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR, but will create new tags only in their preferred
groups.  This allows some information to be automatically transferred to the
appropriate group when copying between images of different formats. However,
if a group name is specified for a tag then the information is written only
to this group (unless redirected to another group, see below).  If \f(CW\*(C`All\*(C'\fR is
used as a group name, then the specified tag(s) are written to the same
family 1 group they had in the source file (ie. the same specific location,
like ExifIFD or XMP-dc).  For example, the common operation of copying all
writable tags to the same specific locations in the output \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR is
achieved by adding \f(CW\*(C`\-all:all\*(C'\fR.  A different family may be specified by
adding a leading family number to the group name (eg. \f(CW\*(C`\-0all:all\*(C'\fR preserves
the same general location, like \s-1EXIF\s0 or \s-1XMP\s0).
.Sp
\&\fI\s-1SRCFILE\s0\fR may be the same as \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR to move information around within a
single file.  In this case, \f(CW\*(C`@\*(C'\fR may be used to represent the source file
(ie. \f(CW\*(C`\-tagsFromFile @\*(C'\fR), permitting this feature to be used for batch
processing multiple files.  Specified tags are then copied from each file in
turn as it is rewritten.  For advanced batch use, the source file name may
also be specified using a \fI\s-1FMT\s0\fR string in which \f(CW%d\fR, \f(CW%f\fR and \f(CW%e\fR represent the
directory, file name and extension of \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR.  (eg. the current \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR
would be represented by \f(CW\*(C`%d%f.%e\*(C'\fR, with the same effect as \f(CW\*(C`@\*(C'\fR).  See the
\&\fB\-w\fR option for \fI\s-1FMT\s0\fR string examples.
.Sp
A powerful redirection feature allows a destination tag to be specified for
each copied tag.  With this feature, information may be written to a tag
with a different name or group.  This is done using
"'\-\fI\s-1DSTTAG\s0\fR<\fI\s-1SRCTAG\s0\fR'\*(L" or
\&\*(R"'\-\fI\s-1SRCTAG\s0\fR>\fI\s-1DSTTAG\s0\fR'" on the command line after
\&\fB\-tagsFromFile\fR, and causes the value of \fI\s-1SRCTAG\s0\fR to be copied from
\&\fI\s-1SRCFILE\s0\fR and written to \fI\s-1DSTTAG\s0\fR in \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR.  Has no effect unless
\&\fI\s-1SRCTAG\s0\fR exists in \fI\s-1SRCFILE\s0\fR.  Note that this argument must be quoted to
prevent shell redirection, and there is no \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR sign as when assigning new
values.  Source and/or destination tags may be prefixed by a group name
and/or suffixed by \f(CW\*(C`#\*(C'\fR.  Wildcards are allowed in both the source and
destination tag names.  A destination group and/or tag name of \f(CW\*(C`All\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR writes to the same family 1 group and/or tag name as the source.  If no
destination group is specified, the information is written to the preferred
group.  Whitespace around the \f(CW\*(C`>\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`<\*(C'\fR is ignored. As a
convenience, \f(CW\*(C`\-tagsFromFile @\*(C'\fR is assumed for any redirected tags which are
specified without a prior \fB\-tagsFromFile\fR option.  Copied tags may also be
added or deleted from a list with arguments of the form
"'\-\fI\s-1SRCTAG\s0\fR+<\fI\s-1DSTTAG\s0\fR'\*(L" or
\&\*(R"'\-\fI\s-1SRCTAG\s0\fR\-<\fI\s-1DSTTAG\s0\fR'" (but see Note 5 below).
.Sp
An extension of the redirection feature allows strings involving tag names
to be used on the right hand side of the \f(CW\*(C`<\*(C'\fR symbol with the syntax
"'\-\fI\s-1DSTTAG\s0\fR<\fI\s-1STR\s0\fR'", where tag names in \fI\s-1STR\s0\fR are
prefixed with a \f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR symbol.  See the \fB\-p\fR option and the
\&\*(L"Advanced formatting feature\*(R" section for more details about this syntax. 
Strings starting with a \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR sign must insert a single space after the
\&\f(CW\*(C`<\*(C'\fR to avoid confusion with the \f(CW\*(C`<=\*(C'\fR operator which sets the tag
value from the contents of a file.  A single space at the start of the
string is removed if it exists, but all other whitespace in the string is
preserved.  See note 8 below about using the redirection feature with
list-type stags, shortcuts or when using wildcards in tag names.
.Sp
See \*(L"\s-1COPYING EXAMPLES\*(R"\s0 for examples using \fB\-tagsFromFile\fR.
.Sp
Notes:
.Sp
1) Some tags (generally tags which may affect the appearance of the image)
are considered \*(L"Unsafe\*(R" to write, and are only copied if specified
explicitly (ie. no wildcards).  See the
tag name documentation for more details about
\&\*(L"Unsafe\*(R" tags.
.Sp
2) Be aware of the difference between excluding a tag from being copied
(\-\-\fI\s-1TAG\s0\fR), and deleting a tag (\-\fI\s-1TAG\s0\fR=).  Excluding a tag prevents it from
being copied to the destination image, but deleting will remove a
pre-existing tag from the image.
.Sp
3) The maker note information is copied as a block, so it isn't affected
like other information by subsequent tag assignments on the command line,
and individual makernote tags may not be excluded from a block copy.  Also,
since the PreviewImage referenced from the maker notes may be rather large,
it is not copied, and must be transferred separately if desired.
.Sp
4) The order of operations is to copy all specified tags at the point of the
\&\fB\-tagsFromFile\fR option in the command line.  Any tag assignment to the
right of the \fB\-tagsFromFile\fR option is made after all tags are copied.  For
example, new tag values are set in the order One, Two, Three then Four with
this command:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    exiftool \-One=1 \-tagsFromFile s.jpg \-Two \-Four=4 \-Three d.jpg
.Ve
.Sp
This is significant in the case where an overlap exists between the copied
and assigned tags because later operations may override earlier ones.
.Sp
5) The normal behaviour of copied tags differs from that of assigned tags
for list-type tags and conditional replacements because each copy operation
on a tag overrides any previous operations.  While this avoids duplicate
list items when copying groups of tags from a file containing redundant
information, it also prevents values of different tags from being copied
into the same list when this is the intent.  So a \fB\-addTagsFromFile\fR option
is provided which allows copying of multiple tags into the same list.  eg)
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    exiftool \-addtagsfromfile @ \*(Aq\-subject<make\*(Aq \*(Aq\-subject<model\*(Aq ...
.Ve
.Sp
Similarly, \fB\-addTagsFromFile\fR must be used when conditionally replacing a
tag to prevent overriding earlier conditions.
.Sp
Other than these differences, the \fB\-tagsFromFile\fR and \fB\-addTagsFromFile\fR
options are equivalent.
.Sp
6) The \fB\-a\fR option (allow duplicate tags) is always in effect when copying
tags from \fI\s-1SRCFILE\s0\fR, but the highest priority tag is always copied last so
it takes precedence.
.Sp
7) Structured tags are copied by default when copying tags.  See the
\&\fB\-struct\fR option for details.
.Sp
8) With the redirection feature, copying a tag directly (ie.
"'\-\fI\s-1DSTTAG\s0\fR<\fI\s-1SRCTAG\s0\fR'\*(L") is not the same as interpolating
its value inside a string (ie. \*(R"'\-\fI\s-1DSTTAG\s0\fR<$\fI\s-1SRCTAG\s0\fR'")
for source tags which are list-type tags,
shortcut tags, tag names containing wildcards,
or UserParam variables.  When copying directly, the values of each matching
source tag are copied individually to the destination tag (as if they were
separate assignments).  However, when interpolated inside a string, list
items and the values of shortcut tags are concatenated (with a separator set
by the \fB\-sep\fR option), and wildcards are not allowed.  Also, UserParam
variables are available only when interpolated in a string.  Another
difference is that a minor warning is generated if a tag doesn't exist when
interpolating its value in a string (with \f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR), but isn't when copying the
tag directly.
.Sp
Finally, the behaviour is different when a destination tag or group of
\&\f(CW\*(C`All\*(C'\fR is used.  When copying directly, a destination group and/or tag name
of \f(CW\*(C`All\*(C'\fR writes to the same family 1 group and/or tag name as the source. 
But when interpolated in a string, the identity of the source tags are lost
and the value is written to all possible groups/tags.  For example, the
string form must be used in the following command since the intent is to set
the value of all existing date/time tags from \f(CW\*(C`CreateDate\*(C'\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 1

.IP "\fB\-args\fR (\fB\-argFormat\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-args (-argFormat)"
Output information in the form of exiftool arguments, suitable for use with
the \fB\-@\fR option when writing.  May be combined with the \fB\-G\fR option to
include group names.  This feature may be used to effectively copy tags
between images, but allows the metadata to be altered by editing the
intermediate file (\f(CW\*(C`out.args\*(C'\fR in this example):
.Sp
.Vb 2

\&    exiftool \-@ out.args \-sep \*(Aq, \*(Aq dst.jpg
.Ve
.Sp
Note:  Be careful when copying information with this technique since it is
easy to write tags which are normally considered \*(L"Unsafe\*(R".  For instance,
the FileName and Directory tags are excluded in the example above to avoid
renaming and moving the destination file.  Also note that the second command
above will produce warning messages for any tags which are not writable.
.Sp
As well, the \fB\-sep\fR option should be used as in the second command above to
maintain separate list items when writing metadata back to image files, and
the \fB\-struct\fR option may be used when extracting to preserve structured \s-1XMP\s0
information.

.IX Item "-b, --b (-binary, --binary)"
Output requested metadata in binary format without tag names or descriptions
(\fB\-b\fR or \fB\-binary\fR).  This option is mainly used for extracting embedded
images or other binary data, but it may also be useful for some text strings
since control characters (such as newlines) are not replaced by '.' as they
are in the default output.  By default, list items are separated by a
newline when extracted with the \fB\-b\fR option, but this may be changed (see
the \fB\-sep\fR option for details).  May be combined with \fB\-j\fR, \fB\-php\fR or
\&\fB\-X\fR to extract binary data in \s-1JSON, PHP\s0 or \s-1XML\s0 format, but note that
\&\*(L"Unsafe\*(R" tags are not extracted as binary unless they are specified
explicitly or the \s-1API\s0 RequestAll option is set to 3 or higher.

With a leading double dash (\fB\-\-b\fR or \fB\-\-binary\fR), tags which contain
binary data are suppressed in the output when reading.

1) To avoid loss of precision, the default coordinate format is different
when copying tags using the \fB\-tagsFromFile\fR option.

2) If the hemisphere is known, a reference direction (N, S, E or W) is
appended to each printed coordinate, but adding a \f(CW\*(C`+\*(C'\fR to the format
specifier (eg. \f(CW\*(C`%+.6f\*(C'\fR) prints a signed coordinate instead.

\&\fI\s-1TYPE\s0\fR may be \f(CW\*(C`FileName\*(C'\fR to specify the encoding of file names on the

.IP "\fB\-csv\fR[[+]=\fI\s-1CSVFILE\s0\fR]" 5
.IX Item "-csv[[+]=CSVFILE]"
Export information in \s-1CSV\s0 format, or import information if \fI\s-1CSVFILE\s0\fR is
specified.  When importing, the \s-1CSV\s0 file must be in exactly the same format
as the exported file.  The first row of the \fI\s-1CSVFILE\s0\fR must be the ExifTool
tag names (with optional group names) for each column of the file, and
values must be separated by commas.  A special \*(L"SourceFile\*(R" column specifies
the files associated with each row of information (and a SourceFile of \*(L"*\*(R"
may be used to define default tags to be imported for all files which are
combined with any tags specified for the specific SourceFile processed). The
\&\fB\-csvDelim\fR option may be used to change the input/output field delimiter
if something other than a comma is required.
.Sp
The following examples demonstrate basic use of the \fB\-csv\fR option:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    # generate CSV file with common tags from all images in a directory
\&    exiftool \-common \-csv dir > out.csv
\&
\&    # update metadata for all images in a directory from CSV file
\&    exiftool \-csv=a.csv dir
.Ve
.Sp
When importing, empty values are ignored unless the \fB\-f\fR option is used and
the \s-1API\s0 MissingTagValue is set to an empty string (in which case the tag is
deleted).  Also, FileName and Directory columns are ignored if they exist
(ie. ExifTool will not attempt to write these tags with a \s-1CSV\s0 import), but
all other columns are imported.  To force a tag to be deleted, use the \fB\-f\fR
option and set the value to \*(L"\-\*(R" in the \s-1CSV\s0 file (or to the MissingTagValue
if this \s-1API\s0 option was used).  Multiple databases may be imported in a
single command.
.Sp
When exporting a \s-1CSV\s0 file, the \fB\-g\fR or \fB\-G\fR option adds group names to the
tag headings.  If the \fB\-a\fR option is used to allow duplicate tag names, the
duplicate tags are only included in the \s-1CSV\s0 output if the column headings
are unique.  Adding the \fB\-G4\fR option ensures a unique column heading for
each tag.  The \fB\-b\fR option may be added to output binary data, encoded in
base64 if necessary (indicated by \s-1ASCII\s0 \*(L"base64:\*(R" as the first 7 bytes of
the value).  Values may also be encoded in base64 if the \fB\-charset\fR option
is used and the value contains invalid characters.
.Sp
When exporting specific tags, the \s-1CSV\s0 columns are arranged in the same order
as the specified tags provided the column headings exactly match the
specified tag names, otherwise the columns are sorted in alphabetical order.
.Sp
When importing from a \s-1CSV\s0 file, only files specified on the command line are
processed.  Any extra entries in the \s-1CSV\s0 file are ignored.
.Sp
List-type tags are stored as simple strings in a \s-1CSV\s0 file, but the \fB\-sep\fR
option may be used to split them back into separate items when importing.
.Sp
Special feature:  \fB\-csv\fR+=\fI\s-1CSVFILE\s0\fR may be used to add items to existing
lists.  This affects only list-type tags.  Also applies to the \fB\-j\fR option.
.Sp
Note that this option is fundamentally different than all other output
format options because it requires information from all input files to be
buffered in memory before the output is written.  This may result in
excessive memory usage when processing a very large number of files with a
single command.  Also, it makes this option incompatible with the \fB\-w\fR
option.  When processing a large number of files, it is recommended to
either use the \s-1JSON\s0 (\fB\-j\fR) or \s-1XML\s0 (\fB\-X\fR) output format, or use \fB\-p\fR to
generate a fixed-column \s-1CSV\s0 file instead of using the \fB\-csv\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-csvDelim\fR \fI\s-1STR\s0\fR" 5
.IX Item "-csvDelim STR"
Set the delimiter for separating \s-1CSV\s0 entries for \s-1CSV\s0 file input/output via
the \fB\-csv\fR option.  \fI\s-1STR\s0\fR may contain \*(L"\et\*(R", \*(L"\en\*(R", \*(L"\er\*(R" and \*(L"\e\e\*(R" to
represent \s-1TAB, LF, CR\s0 and '\e' respectively.  A double quote is not allowed
in the delimiter.  Default is ','.
.IP "\fB\-d\fR \fI\s-1FMT\s0\fR (\fB\-dateFormat\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-d FMT (-dateFormat)"
Set the format for date/time tag values.  The \fI\s-1FMT\s0\fR string may contain
formatting codes beginning with a percent character (\f(CW\*(C`%\*(C'\fR) to represent the
various components of a date/time value.  The specifics of the \fI\s-1FMT\s0\fR syntax
are system dependent \*(-- consult the \f(CW\*(C`strftime\*(C'\fR man page on your system for
details.  The default format is equivalent to \*(L"%Y:%m:%d \f(CW%H:\fR%M:%S\*(R".  This
option has no effect on date-only or time-only tags and ignores timezone
information if present.  ExifTool adds a \f(CW%f\fR format code to represent
fractional seconds, and supports an optional width to specify the number of
digits after the decimal point (eg. \f(CW%3f\fR would give something like
\&\f(CW.437\fR), and a minus sign to drop the decimal point (eg. \f(CW\*(C`%\-3f\*(C'\fR would give
\&\f(CW437\fR).  Only one \fB\-d\fR option may be used per command.  Requires
POSIX::strptime or Time::Piece for the inversion conversion when writing.
.IP "\fB\-D\fR (\fB\-decimal\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-D (-decimal)"
Show tag \s-1ID\s0 number in decimal when extracting information.

.IX Item "-E, -ex, -ec (-escapeHTML, -escapeXML, -escapeC)"
Escape characters in output tag values for \s-1HTML\s0 (\fB\-E\fR), \s-1XML\s0 (\fB\-ex\fR) or C
(\fB\-ec\fR).  For \s-1HTML,\s0 all characters with Unicode code points above U+007F
are escaped as well as the following 5 characters: & (&amp;) ' (&#39;)
" (&quot;) > (&gt;) and < (&lt;).  For \s-1XML,\s0 only these 5
characters are escaped.  The \fB\-E\fR option is implied with \fB\-h\fR, and \fB\-ex\fR
is implied with \fB\-X\fR.  For C, all control characters and the backslash are
escaped.  The inverse conversion is applied when writing tags.
.IP "\fB\-f\fR (\fB\-forcePrint\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-f (-forcePrint)"
Force printing of tags even if their values are not found.  This option only
applies when specific tags are requested on the command line (ie. not with
wildcards or by \f(CW\*(C`\-all\*(C'\fR).  With this option, a dash (\f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR) is printed for
the value of any missing tag, but the dash may be changed via the \s-1API\s0
MissingTagValue option.  May also be used to add a 'flags' attribute to the
\&\fB\-listx\fR output, or to allow tags to be deleted when writing with the
\&\fB\-csv\fR=\fI\s-1CSVFILE\s0\fR feature.
.IP "\fB\-g\fR[\fI\s-1NUM\s0\fR][:\fI\s-1NUM\s0\fR...] (\fB\-groupHeadings\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-g[NUM][:NUM...] (-groupHeadings)"
Organize output by tag group.  \fI\s-1NUM\s0\fR specifies a group family number, and
may be 0 (general location), 1 (specific location), 2 (category), 3
(document number), 4 (instance number), 5 (metadata path), 6 (\s-1EXIF/TIFF\s0
format) or 7 (tag \s-1ID\s0).  \fB\-g0\fR is assumed if a family number is not
specified.  May be combined with other options to add group names to the
output.  Multiple families may be specified by separating them with colons. 
By default the resulting group name is simplified by removing any leading
\&\f(CW\*(C`Main:\*(C'\fR and collapsing adjacent identical group names, but this can be
avoided by placing a colon before the first family number (eg. \fB\-g:3:1\fR).
Use the \fB\-listg\fR option to list group names for a specified family.  The
\&\s-1API\s0 SavePath and SaveFormat options are automatically enabled if the
respective family 5 or 6 group names are requested.  See the
\&\s-1API\s0 GetGroup documentation for more information.
.IP "\fB\-G\fR[\fI\s-1NUM\s0\fR][:\fI\s-1NUM\s0\fR...] (\fB\-groupNames\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-G[NUM][:NUM...] (-groupNames)"
Same as \fB\-g\fR but print group name for each tag.  \fB\-G0\fR is assumed if
\&\fI\s-1NUM\s0\fR is not specified.  May be combined with a number of other options to
add group names to the output.  Note that \fI\s-1NUM\s0\fR may be added wherever \fB\-G\fR
is mentioned in the documentation.  See the \fB\-g\fR option above for details.
.IP "\fB\-h\fR (\fB\-htmlFormat\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-h (-htmlFormat)"
Use \s-1HTML\s0 table formatting for output.  Implies the \fB\-E\fR option.  The
formatting options \fB\-D\fR, \fB\-H\fR, \fB\-g\fR, \fB\-G\fR, \fB\-l\fR and \fB\-s\fR may be used
in combination with \fB\-h\fR to influence the \s-1HTML\s0 format.
.IP "\fB\-H\fR (\fB\-hex\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-H (-hex)"
Show tag \s-1ID\s0 number in hexadecimal when extracting information.
.IP "\fB\-htmlDump\fR[\fI\s-1OFFSET\s0\fR]" 5
.IX Item "-htmlDump[OFFSET]"
Generate a dynamic web page containing a hex dump of the \s-1EXIF\s0 information.
This can be a very powerful tool for low-level analysis of \s-1EXIF\s0 information.
The \fB\-htmlDump\fR option is also invoked if the \fB\-v\fR and \fB\-h\fR options are
used together.  The verbose level controls the maximum length of the blocks
dumped.  An \fI\s-1OFFSET\s0\fR may be given to specify the base for displayed
offsets.  If not provided, the \s-1EXIF/TIFF\s0 base offset is used.  Use
\&\fB\-htmlDump0\fR for absolute offsets.  Currently only \s-1EXIF/TIFF\s0 and \s-1JPEG\s0
information is dumped, but the \-u option can be used to give a raw hex dump
of other file formats.
.IP "\fB\-j\fR[[+]=\fI\s-1JSONFILE\s0\fR] (\fB\-json\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-j[[+]=JSONFILE] (-json)"
Use \s-1JSON\s0 (JavaScript Object Notation) formatting for console output, or
import \s-1JSON\s0 file if \fI\s-1JSONFILE\s0\fR is specified.  This option may be combined
with \fB\-g\fR to organize the output into objects by group, or \fB\-G\fR to add
group names to each tag.  List-type tags with multiple items are output as
\&\s-1JSON\s0 arrays unless \fB\-sep\fR is used.  By default \s-1XMP\s0 structures are flattened
into individual tags in the \s-1JSON\s0 output, but the original structure may be
preserved with the \fB\-struct\fR option (this also causes all list-type \s-1XMP\s0
tags to be output as \s-1JSON\s0 arrays, otherwise single-item lists would be
output as simple strings).  The \fB\-a\fR option is implied when \fB\-json\fR is
used, but entries with identical \s-1JSON\s0 names are suppressed in the output. 
(\fB\-G4\fR may be used to ensure that all tags have unique \s-1JSON\s0 names.)  Adding
the \fB\-D\fR or \fB\-H\fR option changes tag values to \s-1JSON\s0 objects with \*(L"val\*(R" and
\&\*(L"id\*(R" fields, and adding \fB\-l\fR adds a \*(L"desc\*(R" field, and a \*(L"num\*(R" field if the
numerical value is different from the converted \*(L"val\*(R".  The \fB\-b\fR option may
be added to output binary data, encoded in base64 if necessary (indicated by
\&\s-1ASCII\s0 \*(L"base64:\*(R" as the first 7 bytes of the value), and \fB\-t\fR may be added
to include tag table information (see \fB\-t\fR for details).  The \s-1JSON\s0 output
is \s-1UTF\-8\s0 regardless of any \fB\-L\fR or \fB\-charset\fR option setting, but the
\&\s-1UTF\-8\s0 validation is disabled if a character set other than \s-1UTF\-8\s0 is
specified.  Note that ExifTool quotes \s-1JSON\s0 values only if they don't look
like numbers (regardless of the original storage format or the relevant
metadata specification).
.Sp
If \fI\s-1JSONFILE\s0\fR is specified, the file is imported and the tag definitions
from the file are used to set tag values on a per-file basis.  The special
\&\*(L"SourceFile\*(R" entry in each \s-1JSON\s0 object associates the information with a
specific target file.  An object with a missing SourceFile or a SourceFile
of \*(L"*\*(R" defines default tags for all target files which are combined with any
tags specified for the specific SourceFile processed.  The imported \s-1JSON\s0
file must have the same format as the exported \s-1JSON\s0 files with the exception
that options exporting \s-1JSON\s0 objects instead of simple values are not
compatible with the import file format (ie. export with \fB\-D\fR, \fB\-H\fR, \fB\-l\fR,
or \fB\-T\fR is not compatable, and use \fB\-G\fR instead of \fB\-g\fR).  Additionally,
tag names in the input \s-1JSON\s0 file may be suffixed with a \f(CW\*(C`#\*(C'\fR to disable
print conversion.
.Sp
Unlike \s-1CSV\s0 import, empty values are not ignored, and will cause an empty
value to be written if supported by the specific metadata type.  Tags are
deleted by using the \fB\-f\fR option and setting the tag value to \*(L"\-\*(R" (or to
the MissingTagValue setting if this \s-1API\s0 option was used).  Importing with
\&\fB\-j\fR+=\fI\s-1JSONFILE\s0\fR causes new values to be added to existing lists.
.IP "\fB\-l\fR (\fB\-long\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-l (-long)"
Use long 2\-line Canon-style output format.  Adds a description and
unconverted value (if it is different from the converted value) to the \s-1XML,
JSON\s0 or \s-1PHP\s0 output when \fB\-X\fR, \fB\-j\fR or \fB\-php\fR is used.  May also be
combined with \fB\-listf\fR, \fB\-listr\fR or \fB\-listwf\fR to add descriptions of the
file types.
.IP "\fB\-L\fR (\fB\-latin\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-L (-latin)"
Use Windows Latin1 encoding (cp1252) for output tag values instead of the
default \s-1UTF\-8.\s0  When writing, \fB\-L\fR specifies that input text values are
Latin1 instead of \s-1UTF\-8.\s0  Equivalent to \f(CW\*(C`\-charset latin\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-lang\fR [\fI\s-1LANG\s0\fR]" 5
.IX Item "-lang [LANG]"
Set current language for tag descriptions and converted values.  \fI\s-1LANG\s0\fR is
\&\f(CW\*(C`de\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`fr\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`ja\*(C'\fR, etc.  Use \fB\-lang\fR with no other arguments to get a
list of available languages.  The default language is \f(CW\*(C`en\*(C'\fR if \fB\-lang\fR is
not specified.  Note that tag/group names are always English, independent of
the \fB\-lang\fR setting, and translation of warning/error messages has not yet
been implemented.  May also be combined with \fB\-listx\fR to output
descriptions in one language only.
.Sp
By default, ExifTool uses \s-1UTF\-8\s0 encoding for special characters, but the
\&\fB\-L\fR or \fB\-charset\fR option may be used to invoke other encodings.  Note
that ExifTool uses Unicode::LineBreak if available to help preserve the
column alignment of the plain text output for languages with a
variable-width character set.
.Sp
Currently, the language support is not complete, but users are welcome to
help improve this by submitting their own translations.  To submit a
translation, follow these steps (you must have Perl installed for this):
.Sp
1. Download and unpack the latest Image-ExifTool full distribution.
.Sp
2. 'cd' into the Image-ExifTool directory.
.Sp
3. Run this command to make an \s-1XML\s0 file of the desired tags (eg. \s-1EXIF\s0):
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   ./exiftool \-listx \-exif:all > out.xml
.Ve
.Sp
4. Copy this text into a file called 'import.pl' in the exiftool directory:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    push @INC, \*(Aqlib\*(Aq;
\&    require Image::ExifTool::TagInfoXML;
\&    my $file = shift or die "Expected XML file name\en";
\&    $Image::ExifTool::TagInfoXML::makeMissing = shift;
\&    Image::ExifTool::TagInfoXML::BuildLangModules($file,8);
.Ve
.Sp
5. Run the 'import.pl' script to Import the \s-1XML\s0 file, generating the
\&'\s-1MISSING\s0' entries for your language (eg. Russian):
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   perl import.pl out.xml ru
.Ve
.Sp
6. Edit the generated language module lib/Image/ExifTool/Lang/ru.pm, and
search and replace all '\s-1MISSING\s0' strings in the file with your translations.
.Sp
7. Email the module ('ru.pm' in this example) to philharvey66 at gmail.com
.Sp
8. Thank you!!
.IP "\fB\-listItem\fR \fI\s-1INDEX\s0\fR" 5
.IX Item "-listItem INDEX"
For list-type tags, this causes only the item with the specified index to be
extracted.  \fI\s-1INDEX\s0\fR is 0 for the first item in the list.  Negative indices
may also be used to reference items from the end of the list.  Has no effect
on single-valued tags.  Also applies to tag values when copying from a tag,
and in \fB\-if\fR conditions.
.IP "\fB\-n\fR (\fB\-\-printConv\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-n (--printConv)"
Disable print conversion for all tags.  By default, extracted values are
converted to a more human-readable format, but the \fB\-n\fR option disables
this conversion, revealing the machine-readable values.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    > exiftool \-Orientation \-S a.jpg
\&    Orientation: Rotate 90 CW
\&    > exiftool \-Orientation \-S \-n a.jpg
\&    Orientation: 6
.Ve
.Sp
The print conversion may also be disabled on a per-tag basis by suffixing
the tag name with a \f(CW\*(C`#\*(C'\fR character:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    > exiftool \-Orientation# \-Orientation \-S a.jpg
\&    Orientation: 6
\&    Orientation: Rotate 90 CW
.Ve
.Sp
These techniques may also be used to disable the inverse print conversion
when writing.  For example, the following commands all have the same effect:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    > exiftool \-Orientation=\*(AqRotate 90 CW\*(Aq a.jpg
\&    > exiftool \-Orientation=6 \-n a.jpg
\&    > exiftool \-Orientation#=6 a.jpg

.IP "\fB\-p\fR \fI\s-1FMTFILE\s0\fR or \fI\s-1STR\s0\fR (\fB\-printFormat\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-p FMTFILE or STR (-printFormat)"
Print output in the format specified by the given file or string.  The
argument is interpreted as a string unless a file of that name exists, in
which case the string is loaded from the contents of the file.  Tag names in
the format file or string begin with a \f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR symbol and may contain leading
group names and/or a trailing \f(CW\*(C`#\*(C'\fR (to disable print conversion).  Case is
not significant.  Braces \f(CW\*(C`{}\*(C'\fR may be used around the tag name to separate
it from subsequent text.  Use \f(CW$$\fR to represent a \f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR symbol, and \f(CW$/\fR
for a newline.
.Sp
Multiple \fB\-p\fR options may be used, each contributing a line (or more) of
text to the output.  Lines beginning with \f(CW\*(C`#[HEAD]\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`#[TAIL]\*(C'\fR are
output before the first processed file and after the last processed file
respectively.  Lines beginning with \f(CW\*(C`#[SECT]\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`#[ENDS]\*(C'\fR are output
before and after each section of files.  A section is defined as a group of
consecutive files with the same section header (eg. files are grouped by
directory if \f(CW\*(C`#[SECT]\*(C'\fR contains \f(CW$directory\fR).  Lines beginning with
\&\f(CW\*(C`#[BODY]\*(C'\fR and lines not beginning with \f(CW\*(C`#\*(C'\fR are output for each processed
file.  Lines beginning with \f(CW\*(C`#[IF]\*(C'\fR are not output, but all \s-1BODY\s0 lines are
skipped if any tag on an \s-1IF\s0 line doesn't exist.  Other lines beginning with
\&\f(CW\*(C`#\*(C'\fR are ignored.  (To output a line beginning with \f(CW\*(C`#\*(C'\fR, use \f(CW\*(C`#[BODY]#\*(C'\fR.)
For example, this format file:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    # this is a comment line
\&    #[HEAD]\-\- Generated by ExifTool $exifToolVersion \-\-
\&    File: $FileName \- $DateTimeOriginal
\&    (f/$Aperture, ${ShutterSpeed}s, ISO $EXIF:ISO)

.Ve
.Sp
with this command:
.Sp
.Vb 1

.Sp
The values of List-type tags with multiple items and Shortcut tags
representing multiple tags are joined according the \fB\-sep\fR option setting
when interpolated in the string.
.Sp
When \fB\-ee\fR (\fB\-extractEmbedded\fR) is combined with \fB\-p\fR, embedded documents
are effectively processed as separate input files.
.Sp
If a specified tag does not exist, a minor warning is issued and the line
with the missing tag is not printed.  However, the \fB\-f\fR option may be used
to set the value of missing tags to '\-' (but this may be configured via the
\&\s-1API\s0 MissingTagValue option), or the \fB\-m\fR option may be used to ignore minor
warnings and leave the missing values empty.  Alternatively, \fB\-q \-q\fR may be
used to simply suppress the warning messages.
.Sp
The \*(L"Advanced formatting feature\*(R" may be used to modify the values of
individual tags within the \fB\-p\fR option string.
.Sp
Note that the \s-1API\s0 RequestTags option is automatically set for all tags used
in the \fI\s-1FMTFILE\s0\fR or \fI\s-1STR\s0\fR.  This allows all other tags to be ignored using
\&\fB\-API IgnoreTags=all\fR, resulting in reduced memory usage and increased
speed.
.IP "\fB\-php\fR" 5
.IX Item "-php"
Format output as a \s-1PHP\s0 Array.  The \fB\-g\fR, \fB\-G\fR, \fB\-D\fR, \fB\-H\fR, \fB\-l\fR,
\&\fB\-sep\fR and \fB\-struct\fR options combine with \fB\-php\fR, and duplicate tags are
handled in the same way as with the \fB\-json\fR option.  As well, the \fB\-b\fR
option may be added to output binary data, and \fB\-t\fR may be added to include
tag table information (see \fB\-t\fR for details).  Here is a simple example
showing how this could be used in a \s-1PHP\s0 script:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    <?php
\&    eval(\*(Aq$array=\*(Aq . \`exiftool \-php \-q image.jpg\`);
\&    print_r($array);
\&    ?>
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-s\fR[\fI\s-1NUM\s0\fR] (\fB\-short\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-s[NUM] (-short)"
Short output format.  Prints tag names instead of descriptions.  Add \fI\s-1NUM\s0\fR
or up to 3 \fB\-s\fR options for even shorter formats:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    \-s1 or \-s        \- print tag names instead of descriptions
\&    \-s2 or \-s \-s     \- no extra spaces to column\-align values
\&    \-s3 or \-s \-s \-s  \- print values only (no tag names)
.Ve
.Sp
Also effective when combined with \fB\-t\fR, \fB\-h\fR, \fB\-X\fR or \fB\-listx\fR options.
.IP "\fB\-S\fR (\fB\-veryShort\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-S (-veryShort)"
Very short format.  The same as \fB\-s2\fR or two \fB\-s\fR options.  Tag names are
printed instead of descriptions, and no extra spaces are added to
column-align values.
.IP "\fB\-sep\fR \fI\s-1STR\s0\fR (\fB\-separator\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-sep STR (-separator)"
Specify separator string for items in list-type tags.  When reading, the
default is to join list items with \*(L", \*(R".  When writing, this option causes
values assigned to list-type tags to be split into individual items at each
substring matching \fI\s-1STR\s0\fR (otherwise they are not split by default).  Space
characters in \fI\s-1STR\s0\fR match zero or more whitespace characters in the value.
.Sp
Note that an empty separator ("") is allowed, and will join items with no
separator when reading, or split the value into individual characters when
writing.
.Sp
For pure binary output (\fB\-b\fR used without \fB\-j\fR, \fB\-php\fR or \fB\-X\fR), the
first \fB\-sep\fR option specifies a list-item separator, and a second \fB\-sep\fR
option specifies a terminator for the end of the list (or after each value
if not a list).  In these strings, \f(CW\*(C`\en\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\er\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\et\*(C'\fR may be used to
represent a newline, carriage return and tab respectively.  By default,
binary list items are separated by a newline, and no terminator is added.
.IP "\fB\-sort\fR, \fB\-\-sort\fR" 5
.IX Item "-sort, --sort"
Sort output by tag description, or by tag name if the \fB\-s\fR option is used.
When sorting by description, the sort order will depend on the \fB\-lang\fR
option setting.  Without the \fB\-sort\fR option, tags appear in the order they
were specified on the command line, or if not specified, the order they were
extracted from the file.  By default, tags are organized by groups when
combined with the \fB\-g\fR or \fB\-G\fR option, but this grouping may be disabled
with \fB\-\-sort\fR.
.IP "\fB\-struct\fR, \fB\-\-struct\fR" 5
.IX Item "-struct, --struct"
Output structured \s-1XMP\s0 information instead of flattening to individual tags.
This option works well when combined with the \s-1XML\s0 (\fB\-X\fR) and \s-1JSON\s0 (\fB\-j\fR)
output formats.  For other output formats, \s-1XMP\s0 structures and lists are
serialized into the same format as when writing structured information (see
<https://exiftool.org/struct.html> for details).  When copying, structured
tags are copied by default unless \fB\-\-struct\fR is used to disable this
feature (although flattened tags may still be copied by specifying them
individually unless \fB\-struct\fR is used).  These options have no effect when
assigning new values since both flattened and structured tags may always be
used when writing.
.IP "\fB\-t\fR (\fB\-tab\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-t (-tab)"
Output a tab-delimited list of description/values (useful for database
import).  May be combined with \fB\-s\fR to print tag names instead of
descriptions, or \fB\-S\fR to print tag values only, tab-delimited on a single
line.  The \fB\-t\fR option may be combined with \fB\-j\fR, \fB\-php\fR or \fB\-X\fR to add
tag table information (\f(CW\*(C`table\*(C'\fR, tag \f(CW\*(C`id\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`index\*(C'\fR for cases where
multiple conditional tags exist with the same \s-1ID\s0).
.IP "\fB\-T\fR (\fB\-table\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-T (-table)"
Output tag values in table form.  Equivalent to \fB\-t \-S \-q \-f\fR.
.IP "\fB\-v\fR[\fI\s-1NUM\s0\fR] (\fB\-verbose\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-v[NUM] (-verbose)"
Print verbose messages.  \fI\s-1NUM\s0\fR specifies the level of verbosity in the
range 0\-5, with higher numbers being more verbose.  If \fI\s-1NUM\s0\fR is not given,
then each \fB\-v\fR option increases the level of verbosity by 1.  With any
level greater than 0, most other options are ignored and normal console
output is suppressed unless specific tags are extracted.  Using \fB\-v0\fR
causes the console output buffer to be flushed after each line (which may be
useful to avoid delays when piping exiftool output), and prints the name of
each processed file when writing and the new file name when renaming,
moving or copying.  Verbose levels above \fB\-v0\fR do not flush after each
line.  Also see the \fB\-progress\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-w\fR[+|!] \fI\s-1EXT\s0\fR or \fI\s-1FMT\s0\fR (\fB\-textOut\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-w[+|!] EXT or FMT (-textOut)"
Write console output to files with names ending in \fI\s-1EXT\s0\fR, one for each
source file.  The output file name is obtained by replacing the source file
extension (including the '.') with the specified extension (and a '.' is
added to the start of \fI\s-1EXT\s0\fR if it doesn't already contain one).
Alternatively, a \fI\s-1FMT\s0\fR string may be used to give more control over the
output file name and directory.  In the format string, \f(CW%d\fR, \f(CW%f\fR and \f(CW%e\fR
represent the directory, filename and extension of the source file, and \f(CW%c\fR
represents a copy number which is automatically incremented if the file
already exists.  \f(CW%d\fR includes the trailing '/' if necessary, but \f(CW%e\fR does not
include the leading '.'.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    \-w %d%f.txt       # same effect as "\-w txt"
\&    \-w dir/%f_%e.out  # write files to "dir" as "FILE_EXT.out"
\&    \-w dir2/%d%f.txt  # write to "dir2", keeping dir structure
\&    \-w a%c.txt        # write to "a.txt" or "a1.txt" or "a2.txt"...
.Ve
.Sp
Existing files will not be changed unless an exclamation point is added to
the option name (ie. \fB\-w!\fR or \fB\-textOut!\fR) to overwrite the file, or a
plus sign (ie. \fB\-w+\fR or \fB\-textOut+\fR) to append to the existing file.  Both
may be used (ie. \fB\-w+!\fR or \fB\-textOut+!\fR) to overwrite output files that
didn't exist before the command was run, and append the output from multiple
source files.  For example, to write one output file for all source files in
each directory:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    exiftool \-filename \-createdate \-T \-w+! %d/out.txt \-r DIR
.Ve
.Sp
Capitalized format codes \f(CW%D\fR, \f(CW%F\fR, \f(CW%E\fR and \f(CW%C\fR provide slightly different
alternatives to the lower case versions.  \f(CW%D\fR does not include the trailing
\&'/', \f(CW%F\fR is the full filename including extension, \f(CW%E\fR includes the leading
\&'.', and \f(CW%C\fR increments the count for each processed file (see below).
.Sp
Notes:
.Sp
1) In a Windows \s-1BAT\s0 file the \f(CW\*(C`%\*(C'\fR character is represented by \f(CW\*(C`%%\*(C'\fR, so an
argument like \f(CW\*(C`%d%f.txt\*(C'\fR is written as \f(CW\*(C`%%d%%f.txt\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
2) If the argument for \fB\-w\fR does not contain a valid format code (eg. \f(CW%f\fR),
then it is interpreted as a file extension, but there are three different
ways to create a single output file from multiple source files:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    # 1. Shell redirection
\&    exiftool FILE1 FILE2 ... > out.txt
\&
\&    # 2. With the \-w option and a zero\-width format code
\&    exiftool \-w+! %0fout.txt FILE1 FILE2 ...
\&
\&    # 3. With the \-W option (see the \-W option below)
\&    exiftool \-W+! out.txt FILE1 FILE2 ...
.Ve
.Sp
Advanced features:
.Sp
A substring of the original file name, directory or extension may be taken
by specifying a field width immediately following the '%' character.  If the
width is negative, the substring is taken from the end.  The substring
position (characters to ignore at the start or end of the string) may be
given by a second optional value after a decimal point.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&    Input File Name     Format Specifier    Output File Name
\&    \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-    \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-    \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
\&    Picture\-123.jpg     %7f.txt             Picture.txt
\&    Picture\-123.jpg     %\-.4f.out           Picture.out
\&    Picture\-123.jpg     %7f.%\-3f            Picture.123
\&    Picture\-123a.jpg    Meta%\-3.1f.txt      Meta123.txt
.Ve
.Sp
(Note that special characters may have a width of greater than one.)
.Sp
For \f(CW%d\fR and \f(CW%D\fR, the field width/position specifiers may be applied to the
directory levels instead of substring position by using a colon instead of a
decimal point in the format specifier.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 8
\&    Source Dir     Format   Result       Notes
\&    \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-   \-\-\-\-\-\-   \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-   \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
\&    pics/2012/02   %2:d     pics/2012/   take top 2 levels
\&    pics/2012/02   %\-:1d    pics/2012/   up one directory level
\&    pics/2012/02   %:1d     2012/02/     ignore top level
\&    pics/2012/02   %1:1d    2012/        take 1 level after top
\&    pics/2012/02   %\-1:D    02           bottom level folder name
\&    /Users/phil    %:2d     phil/        ignore top 2 levels
.Ve
.Sp
(Note that the root directory counts as one level when an absolute path is
used as in the last example above.)
.Sp
For \f(CW%c\fR, these modifiers have a different effects.  If a field width is
given, the copy number is padded with zeros to the specified width.  A
leading '\-' adds a dash before the copy number, and a '+' adds an underline.
By default, the copy number is omitted from the first file of a given name,
but this can be changed by adding a decimal point to the modifier.  For
example:
.Sp
.Vb 9
\&    \-w A%\-cZ.txt      # AZ.txt, A\-1Z.txt, A\-2Z.txt ...
\&    \-w B%5c.txt       # B.txt, B00001.txt, B00002.txt ...
\&    \-w C%.c.txt       # C0.txt, C1.txt, C2.txt ...
\&    \-w D%\-.c.txt      # D\-0.txt, D\-1.txt, D\-2.txt ...
\&    \-w E%\-.4c.txt     # E\-0000.txt, E\-0001.txt, E\-0002.txt ...
\&    \-w F%\-.4nc.txt    # F\-0001.txt, F\-0002.txt, F\-0003.txt ...
\&    \-w G%+c.txt       # G.txt, G_1.txt G_2.txt ...
\&    \-w H%\-lc.txt      # H.txt, H\-b.txt, H\-c.txt ...
\&    \-w I.%.3uc.txt    # I.AAA.txt, I.AAB.txt, I.AAC.txt ...
.Ve
.Sp
A special feature allows the copy number to be incremented for each
processed file by using \f(CW%C\fR (upper case) instead of \f(CW%c\fR.  This allows a
sequential number to be added to output file names, even if the names are
different.  For \f(CW%C\fR, a copy number of zero is not omitted as it is with \f(CW%c\fR. 
A leading '\-' causes the number to be reset at the start of each new
directory, and '+' has no effect.  The number before the decimal place gives
the starting index, the number after the decimal place gives the field
width.  The following examples show the output filenames when used with the
command \f(CW\*(C`exiftool rose.jpg star.jpg jet.jpg ...\*(C'\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    \-w %C%f.txt       # 0rose.txt, 1star.txt, 2jet.txt
\&    \-w %f\-%10C.txt    # rose\-10.txt, star\-11.txt, jet\-12.txt
\&    \-w %.3C\-%f.txt    # 000\-rose.txt, 001\-star.txt, 002\-jet.txt
\&    \-w %57.4C%f.txt   # 0057rose.txt, 0058star.txt, 0059jet.txt
.Ve
.Sp
All format codes may be modified by 'l' or 'u' to specify lower or upper
case respectively (ie. \f(CW%le\fR for a lower case file extension).  When used
to modify \f(CW%c\fR or \f(CW%C\fR, the numbers are changed to an alphabetical base (see
example H above).  Also, \f(CW%c\fR and \f(CW%C\fR may be modified by 'n' to count using
natural numbers starting from 1, instead of 0 (see example F above).
.Sp
This same \fI\s-1FMT\s0\fR syntax is used with the \fB\-o\fR and \fB\-tagsFromFile\fR options,
although \f(CW%c\fR and \f(CW%C\fR are only valid for output file names.
.IP "\fB\-W\fR[+|!] \fI\s-1FMT\s0\fR (\fB\-tagOut\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-W[+|!] FMT (-tagOut)"
This enhanced version of the \fB\-w\fR option allows a separate output file to
be created for each extracted tag.  See the \fB\-w\fR option documentation above
for details of the basic functionality.  Listed here are the differences
between \fB\-W\fR and \fB\-w\fR:
.Sp
1) With \fB\-W\fR, a new output file is created for each extracted tag.
.Sp
2) \fB\-W\fR supports four additional format codes:  \f(CW%t\fR, \f(CW%g\fR and \f(CW%s\fR represent the
tag name, group name, and suggested extension for the output file (based on
the format of the data), and \f(CW%o\fR represents the value of the
OriginalRawFileName or OriginalFileName tag from the input file (including
extension).  The \f(CW%g\fR code may be followed by a single digit to specify the
group family number (eg. \f(CW%g1\fR), otherwise family 0 is assumed.  The substring
width/position/case specifiers may be used with these format codes in
exactly the same way as with \f(CW%f\fR and \f(CW%e\fR.
.Sp
3) The argument for \fB\-W\fR is interpreted as a file name if it contains no
format codes.  (For \fB\-w\fR, this would be a file extension.)  This change
allows a simple file name to be specified, which, when combined with the
append feature, provides a method to write metadata from multiple source
files to a single output file without the need for shell redirection.  For
example, the following pairs of commands give the same result:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    # overwriting existing text file
\&    exiftool test.jpg > out.txt     # shell redirection
\&    exiftool test.jpg \-W+! out.txt  # equivalent \-W option
\&
\&    # append to existing text file
\&    exiftool test.jpg >> out.txt    # shell redirection
\&    exiftool test.jpg \-W+ out.txt   # equivalent \-W option
.Ve
.Sp
4) Adding the \fB\-v\fR option to \fB\-W\fR sends a list of the tags and output file
names to the console instead of giving a verbose dump of the entire file. 
(Unless appending all output to one file for each source file by using
\&\fB\-W+\fR with an output file \fI\s-1FMT\s0\fR that does not contain \f(CW%t\fR, \f(CW%g\fR, \f(CW%s\fR or \f(CW%o\fR.)
.Sp
5) Individual list items are stored in separate files when \fB\-W\fR is combined
with \fB\-b\fR, but note that for separate files to be created \f(CW%c\fR or \f(CW%C\fR must be
used in \fI\s-1FMT\s0\fR to give the files unique names.
.IP "\fB\-Wext\fR \fI\s-1EXT\s0\fR, \fB\-\-Wext\fR \fI\s-1EXT\s0\fR (\fB\-tagOutExt\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-Wext EXT, --Wext EXT (-tagOutExt)"
This option is used to specify the type of output file(s) written by the
\&\fB\-W\fR option.  An output file is written only if the suggested extension
matches \fI\s-1EXT\s0\fR.  Multiple \fB\-Wext\fR options may be used to write more than
one type of file.  Use \fB\-\-Wext\fR to write all but the specified type(s).
.IP "\fB\-X\fR (\fB\-xmlFormat\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-X (-xmlFormat)"
Use ExifTool-specific \s-1RDF/XML\s0 formatting for console output.  Implies the
\&\fB\-a\fR option, so duplicate tags are extracted.  The formatting options
\&\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-D\fR, \fB\-H\fR, \fB\-l\fR, \fB\-s\fR, \fB\-sep\fR, \fB\-struct\fR and \fB\-t\fR may be used
in combination with \fB\-X\fR to affect the output, but note that the tag \s-1ID\s0
(\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-H\fR and \fB\-t\fR), binary data (\fB\-b\fR) and structured output
(\fB\-struct\fR) options are not effective for the short output (\fB\-s\fR). Another
restriction of \fB\-s\fR is that only one tag with a given group and name may
appear in the output.  Note that the tag \s-1ID\s0 options (\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-H\fR and \fB\-t\fR)
will produce non-standard \s-1RDF/XML\s0 unless the \fB\-l\fR option is also used.
.Sp
By default, \fB\-X\fR outputs flattened tags, so \fB\-struct\fR should be added if
required to preserve \s-1XMP\s0 structures.  List-type tags with multiple values
are formatted as an \s-1RDF\s0 Bag, but they are combined into a single string when
\&\fB\-s\fR or \fB\-sep\fR is used.  Using \fB\-L\fR changes the \s-1XML\s0 encoding from \*(L"\s-1UTF\-8\*(R"\s0
to \*(L"windows\-1252\*(R".  Other \fB\-charset\fR settings change the encoding only if
there is a corresponding standard \s-1XML\s0 character set.  The \fB\-b\fR option
causes binary data values to be written, encoded in base64 if necessary. 
The \fB\-t\fR option adds tag table information to the output (see \fB\-t\fR for
details).
.Sp
Note:  This output is \s-1NOT\s0 the same as \s-1XMP\s0 because it uses
dynamically-generated property names corresponding to the ExifTool tag names
with ExifTool family 1 group names as namespaces, and not the standard \s-1XMP\s0
properties and namespaces.  To write \s-1XMP\s0 instead, use the \fB\-o\fR option with
an \s-1XMP\s0 extension for the output file.

Extract information from embedded documents in \s-1EPS\s0 files, embedded \s-1EPS\s0
information and \s-1JPEG\s0 and Jpeg2000 images in \s-1PDF\s0 files, embedded \s-1MPF\s0 images
in \s-1JPEG\s0 and \s-1MPO\s0 files, streaming metadata in \s-1AVCHD\s0 videos, and the resource
fork of Mac \s-1OS\s0 files.  Implies the \fB\-a\fR option.  Use \fB\-g3\fR or \fB\-G3\fR to
identify the originating document for extracted information.  Embedded
documents containing sub-documents are indicated with dashes in the family 3
group name.  (eg. \f(CW\*(C`Doc2\-3\*(C'\fR is the 3rd sub-document of the 2nd embedded
document.) Note that this option may increase processing time substantially,
especially for \s-1PDF\s0 files with many embedded images or videos with streaming
metadata.
.Sp
When used with \fB\-ee\fR, the \fB\-p\fR option is evaluated for each embedded
document as if it were a separate input file.  This allows, for example,
generation of \s-1GPS\s0 track logs from timed metadata in videos.  See
<https://exiftool.org/geotag.html#Inverse> for examples.
.Sp
Setting \fI\s-1NUM\s0\fR to 2 causes the H264 video stream in \s-1MP4\s0 videos to be parsed
until the first Supplemental Enhancement Information (\s-1SEI\s0) message is
decoded, or 3 to parse the entire H624 stream and decode all \s-1SEI\s0
information.  For M2TS videos, a setting of 3 causes the entire file to be
parsed in search of unlisted programs which may contain timed \s-1GPS.\s0

Process only files with (\fB\-ext\fR) or without (\fB\-\-ext\fR) a specified
extension.  There may be multiple \fB\-ext\fR and \fB\-\-ext\fR options.  A plus sign
may be added (ie. \fB\-ext+\fR) to add the specified extension to the normally
processed files.  \s-1EXT\s0 may begin with a leading '.', which is ignored.  Case
is not significant.  \f(CW"*"\fR may be used to process files with any extension
(or none at all), as in the last three examples:
.Sp
.Vb 6

\&    exiftool \-ext "*" \-\-ext xml DIR   # process all but XML files
\&    exiftool \-ext "*" \-\-ext . DIR     # all but those with no ext
.Ve
.Sp
Using this option has two main advantages over specifying \f(CW\*(C`*.\f(CIEXT\f(CW\*(C'\fR on the
command line:  1) It applies to files in subdirectories when combined with
the \fB\-r\fR option.  2) The \fB\-ext\fR option is case-insensitive, which is
useful when processing files on case-sensitive filesystems.
.Sp
Note that all files specified on the command line will be processed
regardless of extension unless the \fB\-ext\fR option is used.
.IP "\fB\-F\fR[\fI\s-1OFFSET\s0\fR] (\fB\-fixBase\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-F[OFFSET] (-fixBase)"
Fix the base for maker notes offsets.  A common problem with some image
editors is that offsets in the maker notes are not adjusted properly when
the file is modified.  This may cause the wrong values to be extracted for
some maker note entries when reading the edited file.  This option allows an
integer \fI\s-1OFFSET\s0\fR to be specified for adjusting the maker notes base offset.
If no \fI\s-1OFFSET\s0\fR is given, ExifTool takes its best guess at the correct base.
Note that exiftool will automatically fix the offsets for images which store
original offset information (eg. newer Canon models).  Offsets are fixed
permanently if \fB\-F\fR is used when writing \s-1EXIF\s0 to an image. eg)
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    exiftool \-F \-exif:resolutionunit=inches image.jpg
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-fast\fR[\fI\s-1NUM\s0\fR]" 5
.IX Item "-fast[NUM]"
Increase speed of extracting information.  With \fB\-fast\fR (or \fB\-fast1\fR),
ExifTool will not scan to the end of a \s-1JPEG\s0 image to check for an \s-1AFCP\s0 or
PreviewImage trailer, or past the first comment in \s-1GIF\s0 images or the
audio/video data in \s-1WAV/AVI\s0 files to search for additional metadata.  These
speed benefits are small when reading images directly from disk, but can be
substantial if piping images through a network connection.  For more
substantial speed benefits, \fB\-fast2\fR also causes exiftool to avoid
extracting any \s-1EXIF\s0 MakerNote information, and to stop processing at the
\&\s-1IDAT\s0 chunk of \s-1PNG\s0 images and the mdat atom of QuickTime-format files (but
note that some files may store metadata after this).  \fB\-fast3\fR avoids
extracting metadata from the file, and returns only pseudo System tags, but
still reads the file header to obtain an educated guess at FileType.
\&\fB\-fast4\fR doesn't even read the file header, and returns only System tags
and a FileType based on the file extension.  \fB\-fast5\fR also disables
generation of the Composite tags (like \fB\-e\fR).  Has no effect when writing.
.Sp
Note that a separate \fB\-fast\fR setting may be used for evaluation of a \fB\-if\fR
condition, or when ordering files with the \fB\-fileOrder\fR option.  See the
\&\fB\-if\fR and \fB\-fileOrder\fR options for details.
.IP "\fB\-fileOrder\fR[\fI\s-1NUM\s0\fR] [\-]\fI\s-1TAG\s0\fR" 5
.IX Item "-fileOrder[NUM] [-]TAG"
Set file processing order according to the sorted value of the specified
\&\fI\s-1TAG\s0\fR.  For example, to process files in order of date:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    exiftool \-fileOrder DateTimeOriginal DIR
.Ve
.Sp
Additional \fB\-fileOrder\fR options may be added for secondary sort keys.
Numbers are sorted numerically, and all other values are sorted
alphabetically.  Files missing the specified tag are sorted last.  The sort
order may be reversed by prefixing the tag name with a \f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR (eg.
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-fileOrder \-createdate\*(C'\fR).  Print conversion of the sorted values is
disabled with the \fB\-n\fR option, or a \f(CW\*(C`#\*(C'\fR appended to the tag name.  Other
formatting options (eg. \fB\-d\fR) have no effect on the sorted values.  Note
that the \fB\-fileOrder\fR option can incur large performance penalty since it
involves an additional initial processing pass of all files, but this impact
may be reduced by specifying a \fI\s-1NUM\s0\fR to effectively set the \fB\-fast\fR level
for the initial pass.  For example, \fB\-fileOrder4\fR may be used if \fI\s-1TAG\s0\fR is
a pseudo System tag.  If multiple \fB\-fileOrder\fR options are used, the
extraction is done at the lowest \fB\-fast\fR level.  Note that files are sorted
across directory boundaries if multiple input directories are specified.
.IP "\fB\-i\fR \fI\s-1DIR\s0\fR (\fB\-ignore\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-i DIR (-ignore)"
Ignore specified directory name.  \fI\s-1DIR\s0\fR may be either an individual folder
name, or a full path.  If a full path is specified, it must match the
Directory tag exactly to be ignored.  Use multiple \fB\-i\fR options to ignore
more than one directory name.  A special \fI\s-1DIR\s0\fR value of \f(CW\*(C`SYMLINKS\*(C'\fR (case
sensitive) may be specified to avoid recursing into directories which are
symbolic links when the \fB\-r\fR option is used.  As well, a value of \f(CW\*(C`HIDDEN\*(C'\fR
(case sensitive) may be used to ignore files with names that start with a
\&\*(L".\*(R" (ie. hidden files on Unix systems) when scanning a directory.
.IP "\fB\-if\fR[\fI\s-1NUM\s0\fR] \fI\s-1EXPR\s0\fR" 5
.IX Item "-if[NUM] EXPR"
Specify a condition to be evaluated before processing each \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR.  \fI\s-1EXPR\s0\fR
is a Perl-like logic expression containing tag names prefixed by \f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR
symbols.  It is evaluated with the tags from each \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR in turn, and the
file is processed only if the expression returns true.  Unlike Perl variable
names, tag names are not case sensitive and may contain a hyphen.  As well,
tag names may have a leading group names separated by colons, and/or a
trailing \f(CW\*(C`#\*(C'\fR character to disable print conversion.  The expression
\&\f(CW$GROUP:all\fR evaluates to 1 if any tag exists in the specified \f(CW\*(C`GROUP\*(C'\fR, or
0 otherwise (see note 2 below).  When multiple \fB\-if\fR options are used, all
conditions must be satisfied to process the file.  Returns an exit status of
2 if all files fail the condition.  Below are a few examples:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    # extract shutterspeed from all Canon images in a directory
\&    exiftool \-shutterspeed \-if \*(Aq$make eq "Canon"\*(Aq dir
\&
\&    # add one hour to all images created on or after Apr. 2, 2006
\&    exiftool \-alldates+=1 \-if \*(Aq$CreateDate ge "2006:04:02"\*(Aq dir
\&
\&    # set EXIF ISO value if possible, unless it is set already
\&    exiftool \*(Aq\-exif:iso<iso\*(Aq \-if \*(Aqnot $exif:iso\*(Aq dir
\&
\&    # find images containing a specific keyword (case insensitive)
\&    exiftool \-if \*(Aq$keywords =~ /harvey/i\*(Aq \-filename dir
.Ve
.Sp
Adding \fI\s-1NUM\s0\fR to the \fB\-if\fR option causes a separate processing pass to be
executed for evaluating \fI\s-1EXPR\s0\fR at a \fB\-fast\fR level given by \fI\s-1NUM\s0\fR (see the
\&\fB\-fast\fR option documentation for details).  Without \fI\s-1NUM\s0\fR, only one
processing pass is done at the level specified by the \fB\-fast\fR option.  For
example, using \fB\-if5\fR is possible if \fI\s-1EXPR\s0\fR uses only pseudo System tags,
and may significantly speed processing if enough files fail the condition.
.Sp
The expression has access to the current ExifTool object through \f(CW$self\fR,
and the following special functions are available to allow short-circuiting
of the file processing.  Both functions have a return value of 1.  Case is
significant for function names.
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    End()    \- end processing after this file
\&    EndDir() \- end processing of files in this directory (not
\&               compatible with the B<\-fileOrder> option)
.Ve
.Sp
Notes:
.Sp
1) The \fB\-n\fR and \fB\-b\fR options also apply to tags used in \fI\s-1EXPR\s0\fR.
.Sp
2) Some binary data blocks are not extracted unless specified explicitly.
These tags are not available for use in the \fB\-if\fR condition unless they are
also specified on the command line.  The alternative is to use the
\&\f(CW$GROUP:all\fR syntax. (eg. Use \f(CW$exif:all\fR instead of \f(CW$exif\fR in \fI\s-1EXPR\s0\fR
to test for the existence of \s-1EXIF\s0 tags.)
.Sp
3) Tags in the string are interpolated in a similar way to \fB\-p\fR before the
expression is evaluated.  In this interpolation, \f(CW$/\fR is converted to a
newline and \f(CW$$\fR represents a single \f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR symbol.  So Perl variables, if
used, require a double \f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR, and regular expressions ending in \f(CW$/\fR must
use \f(CW$$/\fR instead.
.Sp
4) The condition may only test tags from the file being processed.  To
process one file based on tags from another, two steps are required.  For
example, to process \s-1XMP\s0 sidecar files in directory \f(CW\*(C`DIR\*(C'\fR based on tags from
the associated \s-1NEF:\s0
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    exiftool \-if EXPR \-p \*(Aq$directory/$filename\*(Aq \-ext nef DIR > nef.txt
\&    exiftool \-@ nef.txt \-srcfile %d%f.xmp ...
.Ve
.Sp
5) The \fB\-a\fR option has no effect on the evaluation of the expression, and
the values of duplicate tags are accessible only by specifying a group name
(such as a family 4 instance number, eg. \f(CW$Copy1:TAG\fR, \f(CW$Copy2:TAG\fR, etc).
.Sp
6) A special \*(L"\s-1OK\*(R"\s0 UserParam is available to test the success of the previous
command when \fB\-execute\fR was used, and may be used like any other tag in the
condition (ie. \*(L"$OK\*(R").
.Sp
7) The \s-1API\s0 RequestTags option is automatically set for all tags used in the
\&\fB\-if\fR condition.
.IP "\fB\-m\fR (\fB\-ignoreMinorErrors\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-m (-ignoreMinorErrors)"
Ignore minor errors and warnings.  This enables writing to files with minor
errors and disables some validation checks which could result in minor
warnings.  Generally, minor errors/warnings indicate a problem which usually
won't result in loss of metadata if ignored.  However, there are exceptions,
so ExifTool leaves it up to you to make the final decision.  Minor errors
and warnings are indicated by \*(L"[minor]\*(R" at the start of the message.
Warnings which affect processing when ignored are indicated by \*(L"[Minor]\*(R"
(with a capital \*(L"M\*(R").  Note that this causes missing values in
\&\fB\-tagsFromFile\fR, \fB\-p\fR and \fB\-if\fR strings to be set to an empty string
rather than an undefined value.
.IP "\fB\-o\fR \fI\s-1OUTFILE\s0\fR or \fI\s-1FMT\s0\fR (\fB\-out\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-o OUTFILE or FMT (-out)"
Set the output file or directory name when writing information.  Without
this option, when any \*(L"real\*(R" tags are written the original file is renamed
to \f(CW\*(C`FILE_original\*(C'\fR and output is written to \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR.  When writing only
FileName and/or Directory \*(L"pseudo\*(R" tags, \fB\-o\fR causes the file to be copied
instead of moved, but directories specified for either of these tags take
precedence over that specified by the \fB\-o\fR option.
.Sp
\&\fI\s-1OUTFILE\s0\fR may be \f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR to write to stdout.  The output file name may also be
specified using a \fI\s-1FMT\s0\fR string in which \f(CW%d\fR, \f(CW%f\fR and \f(CW%e\fR represent the
directory, file name and extension of \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR.  Also, \f(CW%c\fR may be used to add
a copy number. See the \fB\-w\fR option for \fI\s-1FMT\s0\fR string examples.
.Sp
The output file is taken to be a directory name if it already exists as a
directory or if the name ends with '/'.  Output directories are created if
necessary.  Existing files will not be overwritten.  Combining the
\&\fB\-overwrite_original\fR option with \fB\-o\fR causes the original source file to
be erased after the output file is successfully written.
.Sp
A special feature of this option allows the creation of certain types of
files from scratch, or with the metadata from another type of file.  The
following file types may be created using this technique:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    XMP, EXIF, EXV, MIE, ICC/ICM, VRD, DR4
.Ve
.Sp
The output file type is determined by the extension of \fI\s-1OUTFILE\s0\fR (specified
as \f(CW\*(C`\-.EXT\*(C'\fR when writing to stdout).  The output file is then created from a
combination of information in \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR (as if the \fB\-tagsFromFile\fR option was
used), and tag values assigned on the command line.  If no \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR is
specified, the output file may be created from scratch using only tags
assigned on the command line.
.IP "\fB\-overwrite_original\fR" 5
.IX Item "-overwrite_original"
Overwrite the original \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR (instead of preserving it by adding
\&\f(CW\*(C`_original\*(C'\fR to the file name) when writing information to an image.
Caution: This option should only be used if you already have separate backup
copies of your image files.  The overwrite is implemented by renaming a
temporary file to replace the original.  This deletes the original file and
replaces it with the edited version in a single operation.  When combined
with \fB\-o\fR, this option causes the original file to be deleted if the output
file was successfully written (ie. the file is moved instead of copied).
.IP "\fB\-overwrite_original_in_place\fR" 5
.IX Item "-overwrite_original_in_place"
Similar to \fB\-overwrite_original\fR except that an extra step is added to
allow the original file attributes to be preserved.  For example, on a Mac
this causes the original file creation date, type, creator, label color,
icon, Finder tags, other extended attributes and hard links to the file to
be preserved (but note that the Mac \s-1OS\s0 resource fork is always preserved
unless specifically deleted with \f(CW\*(C`\-rsrc:all=\*(C'\fR).  This is implemented by
opening the original file in update mode and replacing its data with a copy
of a temporary file before deleting the temporary.  The extra step results
in slower performance, so the \fB\-overwrite_original\fR option should be used
instead unless necessary.
.Sp
Note that this option reverts to the behaviour of the \fB\-overwrite_original\fR
option when also writing the FileName and/or Directory tags.
.IP "\fB\-P\fR (\fB\-preserve\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-P (-preserve)"
Preserve the filesystem modification date/time (\f(CW\*(C`FileModifyDate\*(C'\fR) of the
original file when writing.  Note that some filesystems store a creation
date (ie. \f(CW\*(C`FileCreateDate\*(C'\fR on Windows and Mac systems) which is not
affected by this option.  This creation date is preserved on Windows systems
where Win32API::File and Win32::API are available regardless of this
setting.  For other systems, the \fB\-overwrite_original_in_place\fR option may
be used if necessary to preserve the creation date.  The \fB\-P\fR option is
superseded by any value written to the FileModifyDate tag.
.IP "\fB\-password\fR \fI\s-1PASSWD\s0\fR" 5
.IX Item "-password PASSWD"
Specify password to allow processing of password-protected \s-1PDF\s0 documents. 
If a password is required but not given, a warning is issued and the
document is not processed.  This option is ignored if a password is not
required.
.IP "\fB\-progress\fR[:[\fI\s-1TITLE\s0\fR]]" 5
.IX Item "-progress[:[TITLE]]"
Show the progress when processing files.  Without a colon, the \fB\-progress\fR
option adds a progress count in brackets after the name of each processed
file, giving the current file number and the total number of files to be
processed.  Implies the \fB\-v0\fR option, causing the names of processed files
to also be printed when writing.  When combined with the \fB\-if\fR option, the
total count includes all files before the condition is applied, but files
that fail the condition will not have their names printed.
.Sp
If followed by a colon (ie. \fB\-progress:\fR), the console window title is set
according to the specified \fI\s-1TITLE\s0\fR string.  If no \fI\s-1TITLE\s0\fR is given, a
default \fI\s-1TITLE\s0\fR string of \*(L"ExifTool \f(CW%p\fR%%\*(R" is assumed.  In the string, \f(CW%f\fR
represents the file name, \f(CW%p\fR is the progress as a percent, \f(CW%r\fR is the
progress as a ratio, %##b is a progress bar of width \*(L"##\*(R" (20 characters if
\&\*(L"##\*(R" is omitted), and %% is a % character.  May be combined with the normal
\&\fB\-progress\fR option to also show the progress count in console messages. 
(Note: For this feature to function correctly on Mac/Linux, stderr must go
to the console.)
.IP "\fB\-q\fR (\fB\-quiet\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-q (-quiet)"
Quiet processing.  One \fB\-q\fR suppresses normal informational messages, and a
second \fB\-q\fR suppresses warnings as well.  Error messages can not be
suppressed, although minor errors may be downgraded to warnings with the
\&\fB\-m\fR option, which may then be suppressed with \f(CW\*(C`\-q \-q\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-r\fR[.] (\fB\-recurse\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-r[.] (-recurse)"
Recursively process files in subdirectories.  Only meaningful if \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR is
a directory name.  Subdirectories with names beginning with \*(L".\*(R" are not
processed unless \*(L".\*(R" is added to the option name (ie. \fB\-r.\fR or
\&\fB\-recurse.\fR).  By default, exiftool will also follow symbolic links to
directories if supported by the system, but this may be disabled with
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-i SYMLINKS\*(C'\fR (see the \fB\-i\fR option for details).  Combine this with
\&\fB\-ext\fR options to control the types of files processed.
.IP "\fB\-scanForXMP\fR" 5
.IX Item "-scanForXMP"
Scan all files (even unsupported formats) for \s-1XMP\s0 information unless found
already.  When combined with the \fB\-fast\fR option, only unsupported file
types are scanned.  Warning: It can be time consuming to scan large files.
.IP "\fB\-u\fR (\fB\-unknown\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-u (-unknown)"
Extract values of unknown tags.  Add another \fB\-u\fR to also extract unknown
information from binary data blocks.  This option applies to tags with
numerical tag \s-1ID\s0's, and causes tag names like \*(L"Exif_0xc5d9\*(R" to be generated
for unknown information.  It has no effect on information types which have
human-readable tag \s-1ID\s0's (such as \s-1XMP\s0), since unknown tags are extracted
automatically from these formats.
.IP "\fB\-U\fR (\fB\-unknown2\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-U (-unknown2)"
Extract values of unknown tags as well as unknown information from some
binary data blocks.  This is the same as two \fB\-u\fR options.
.IP "\fB\-wm\fR \fI\s-1MODE\s0\fR (\fB\-writeMode\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-wm MODE (-writeMode)"
Set mode for writing/creating tags.  \fI\s-1MODE\s0\fR is a string of one or more
characters from the list below.  The default write mode is \f(CW\*(C`wcg\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    w \- Write existing tags

.Ve
.Sp
For example, use \f(CW\*(C`\-wm cg\*(C'\fR to only create new tags (and avoid editing
existing ones).
.Sp
The level of the group is the SubDirectory level in the metadata structure.
For \s-1XMP\s0 or \s-1IPTC\s0 this is the full \s-1XMP/IPTC\s0 block (the family 0 group), but
for \s-1EXIF\s0 this is the individual \s-1IFD\s0 (the family 1 group).
.IP "\fB\-z\fR (\fB\-zip\fR)" 5
.IX Item "-z (-zip)"
When reading, causes information to be extracted from .gz and .bz2
compressed images (only one image per archive; requires gzip and bzip2 to be
available).  When writing, causes compressed information to be written if
supported by the metadata format (eg. compressed textual metadata in \s-1PNG\s0),
disables the recommended padding in embedded \s-1XMP\s0 (saving 2424 bytes when
writing \s-1XMP\s0 in a file), and writes \s-1XMP\s0 in shorthand format \*(-- the equivalent
of setting the \s-1API\s0 Compress=1 and Compact=\*(L"NoPadding,Shorthand\*(R".

additional arguments, and all arguments must be placed on separate lines).
Blank lines and lines beginning with \f(CW\*(C`#\*(C'\fR are ignored (unless they start
with \f(CW\*(C`#[CSTR]\*(C'\fR, in which case the rest of the line is treated as a C
string, allowing standard C escape sequences such as \*(L"\en\*(R" for a newline). 
White space at the start of a line is removed.  Normal shell processing of
arguments is not performed, which among other things means that arguments
should not be quoted and spaces are treated as any other character.
\&\fI\s-1ARGFILE\s0\fR may exist relative to either the current directory or the
exiftool directory unless an absolute pathname is given.

For example, the following \fI\s-1ARGFILE\s0\fR will set the value of Copyright to

value, avoiding potential conflicts with the \fB\-d\fR option).  For example,
the following two commands are equivalent:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    exiftool \-geotag trk.log image.jpg
\&    exiftool \-geotag trk.log "\-Geotime<DateTimeOriginal#" image.jpg
.Ve
.Sp
When the \f(CW\*(C`Geotime\*(C'\fR value is converted to \s-1UTC,\s0 the local system timezone is
assumed unless the date/time value contains a timezone.  Writing \f(CW\*(C`Geotime\*(C'\fR
causes the following tags to be written (provided they can be calculated
from the track log, and they are supported by the destination metadata
format):  GPSLatitude, GPSLatitudeRef, GPSLongitude, GPSLongitudeRef,
GPSAltitude, GPSAltitudeRef, GPSDateStamp, GPSTimeStamp, GPSDateTime,
GPSTrack, GPSTrackRef, GPSSpeed, GPSSpeedRef, GPSImgDirection,
GPSImgDirectionRef, GPSPitch, GPSRoll, AmbientTemperature and
CameraElevationAngle.  By default, tags are created in \s-1EXIF,\s0 and updated in
\&\s-1XMP\s0 only if they already exist.  However, \f(CW\*(C`EXIF:Geotime\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`XMP:Geotime\*(C'\fR
may be specified to write only \s-1EXIF\s0 or \s-1XMP\s0 tags respectively.  Note that
GPSPitch and GPSRoll are non-standard, and require user-defined tags in
order to be written.
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`Geosync\*(C'\fR tag may be used to specify a time correction which is applied
to each \f(CW\*(C`Geotime\*(C'\fR value for synchronization with \s-1GPS\s0 time.  For example,
the following command compensates for image times which are 1 minute and 20
seconds behind \s-1GPS:\s0
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    exiftool \-geosync=+1:20 \-geotag a.log DIR
.Ve
.Sp
Advanced \f(CW\*(C`Geosync\*(C'\fR features allow a piecewise linear time drift correction
and synchronization from previously geotagged images.  See \*(L"geotag.html\*(R" in
the full ExifTool distribution for more information.
.Sp
Multiple \fB\-geotag\fR options may be used to concatenate \s-1GPS\s0 track log data.
Also, a single \fB\-geotag\fR option may be used to load multiple track log
files by using wildcards in the \fI\s-1TRKFILE\s0\fR name, but note that in this case
\&\fI\s-1TRKFILE\s0\fR must be quoted on most systems (with the notable exception of
Windows) to prevent filename expansion.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    exiftool \-geotag "TRACKDIR/*.log" IMAGEDIR
.Ve
.Sp
Currently supported track file formats are \s-1GPX, NMEA RMC/GGA/GLL, KML, IGC,\s0
Garmin \s-1XML\s0 and \s-1TCX,\s0 Magellan \s-1PMGNTRK,\s0 Honeywell \s-1PTNTHPR,\s0 Bramor gEO, Winplus

.IP "\fB\-globalTimeShift\fR \fI\s-1SHIFT\s0\fR" 5
.IX Item "-globalTimeShift SHIFT"
Shift all formatted date/time values by the specified amount when reading. 
Does not apply to unformatted (\fB\-n\fR) output.  \fI\s-1SHIFT\s0\fR takes the same form
as the date/time shift when writing (see
Image::ExifTool::Shift.pl for details), with a
negative shift being indicated with a minus sign (\f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR) at the start of the

Add features from specified plug-in \fI\s-1MODULE\s0\fR.  Currently, the \s-1MWG\s0 module is
the only plug-in module distributed with exiftool.  This module adds
read/write support for tags as recommended by the Metadata Working Group. 
As a convenience, \f(CW\*(C`\-use MWG\*(C'\fR is assumed if the \f(CW\*(C`MWG\*(C'\fR group is specified
for any tag on the command line.  See the \s-1MWG\s0 Tags

.PD
These utility options automate the maintenance of the \f(CW\*(C`_original\*(C'\fR files
created by exiftool.  They have no effect on files without an \f(CW\*(C`_original\*(C'\fR
copy.  The \fB\-restore_original\fR option restores the specified files from
their original copies by renaming the \f(CW\*(C`_original\*(C'\fR files to replace the
edited versions.  For example, the following command restores the originals
of all \s-1JPG\s0 images in directory \f(CW\*(C`DIR\*(C'\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    exiftool \-restore_original \-ext jpg DIR
.Ve
.Sp
The \fB\-delete_original\fR option deletes the \f(CW\*(C`_original\*(C'\fR copies of all files
specified on the command line.  Without a trailing \f(CW\*(C`!\*(C'\fR this option prompts
for confirmation before continuing.  For example, the following command
deletes \f(CW\*(C`a.jpg_original\*(C'\fR if it exists, after asking \*(L"Are you sure?\*(R":
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    exiftool \-delete_original a.jpg
.Ve
.Sp
These options may not be used with other options to read or write tag values
in the same command, but may be combined with options such \fB\-ext\fR, \fB\-if\fR,
\&\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-q\fR and \fB\-v\fR.

.PP
Among other things, the advanced options allow complex processing to be
performed from a single command without the need for additional scripting.
This may be particularly useful for implementations such as Windows
drag-and-drop applications.  These options may also be used to improve
performance in multi-pass processing by reducing the overhead required to
load exiftool for each invocation.
.IP "\fB\-api\fR \fIOPT[[^]=[\s-1VAL\s0]]\fR" 5
.IX Item "-api OPT[[^]=[VAL]]"
Set ExifTool \s-1API\s0 option.  \fI\s-1OPT\s0\fR is an \s-1API\s0 option name.  The option value is
set to 1 if \fI=VAL\fR is omitted.  If \fI\s-1VAL\s0\fR is omitted, the option value is
set to undef if \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR is used, or an empty string with \f(CW\*(C`^=\*(C'\fR.  See
Image::ExifTool Options for a list of available
\&\s-1API\s0 options.  This overrides \s-1API\s0 options set via the config file.
.IP "\fB\-common_args\fR" 5
.IX Item "-common_args"
Specifies that all arguments following this option are common to all
executed commands when \fB\-execute\fR is used.  This and the \fB\-config\fR option
are the only options that may not be used inside a \fB\-@\fR \fI\s-1ARGFILE\s0\fR.  Note
that by definition this option and its arguments \s-1MUST\s0 come after all other
options on the command line.
.IP "\fB\-config\fR \fI\s-1CFGFILE\s0\fR" 5
.IX Item "-config CFGFILE"
Load specified configuration file instead of the default \*(L".ExifTool_config\*(R".
If used, this option must come before all other arguments on the command
line and applies to all \fB\-execute\fR'd commands.  The \fI\s-1CFGFILE\s0\fR must exist
relative to the current working directory or the exiftool application
directory unless an absolute path is specified.  Loading of the default
config file may be disabled by setting \fI\s-1CFGFILE\s0\fR to an empty string (ie.
"").  See <https://exiftool.org/config.html> and
config_files/example.config in the full ExifTool distribution for details
about the configuration file syntax.
.IP "\fB\-echo\fR[\fI\s-1NUM\s0\fR] \fI\s-1TEXT\s0\fR" 5
.IX Item "-echo[NUM] TEXT"
Echo \fI\s-1TEXT\s0\fR to stdout (\fB\-echo\fR or \fB\-echo1\fR) or stderr (\fB\-echo2\fR).  Text
is output as the command line is parsed, before the processing of any input
files.  \fI\s-1NUM\s0\fR may also be 3 or 4 to output text (to stdout or stderr
respectively) after processing is complete.  For \fB\-echo3\fR and \fB\-echo4\fR,
\&\*(L"${status}\*(R" may be used in the \fI\s-1TEXT\s0\fR string to represent the numerical
exit status of the command (see \*(L"\s-1EXIT STATUS\*(R"\s0).
.IP "\fB\-efile\fR[\fI\s-1NUM\s0\fR][!] \fI\s-1ERRFILE\s0\fR" 5
.IX Item "-efile[NUM][!] ERRFILE"
Save the names of files giving errors (\fI\s-1NUM\s0\fR missing or 1), files that were
unchanged (\fI\s-1NUM\s0\fR is 2), files that fail the \fB\-if\fR condition (\fI\s-1NUM\s0\fR is 4),
or any combination thereof by summing \fI\s-1NUM\s0\fR (eg. \fB\-efile3\fR is the same
has having both \fB\-efile\fR and \fB\-efile2\fR options with the same \fI\s-1ERRFILE\s0\fR).
By default, file names are appended to any existing \fI\s-1ERRFILE\s0\fR, but
\&\fI\s-1ERRFILE\s0\fR is overwritten if an exclamation point is added to the option
(eg. \fB\-efile!\fR).  Saves the name of the file specified by the \fB\-srcfile\fR
option if applicable.
.IP "\fB\-execute\fR[\fI\s-1NUM\s0\fR]" 5
.IX Item "-execute[NUM]"
Execute command for all arguments up to this point on the command line (plus
any arguments specified by \fB\-common_args\fR).  The result is as if the
commands were executed as separate command lines (with the exception of the
\&\fB\-config\fR and \fB\-use\fR options which remain in effect for subsequent
commands).  Allows multiple commands to be executed from a single command
line.  \fI\s-1NUM\s0\fR is an optional number that is echoed in the \*(L"{ready}\*(R" message
when using the \fB\-stay_open\fR feature.  If a \fI\s-1NUM\s0\fR is specified, the \fB\-q\fR
option no longer suppresses the output \*(L"{readyNUM}\*(R" message.
.IP "\fB\-list_dir\fR" 5
.IX Item "-list_dir"
List directories themselves instead of their contents.  This option
effectively causes directories to be treated as normal files when reading
and writing.  For example, with this option the output of the \f(CW\*(C`ls \-la\*(C'\fR
command on Mac/Linux may be approximated by this exiftool command:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    exiftool \-list_dir \-T \-ls\-l \-api systemtags \-fast5 .* *
.Ve
.Sp
(The \fB\-T\fR option formats the output in tab-separated columns, \fB\-ls\-l\fR is a
shortcut tag, the \s-1API\s0 SystemTags option is
required to extract some necessary tags, and the \fB\-fast5\fR option is added
for speed since only system tags are being extracted.)
.IP "\fB\-srcfile\fR \fI\s-1FMT\s0\fR" 5
.IX Item "-srcfile FMT"
Specify a different source file to be processed based on the name of the
original \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR.  This may be useful in some special situations for
processing related preview images or sidecar files.  See the \fB\-w\fR option
for a description of the \fI\s-1FMT\s0\fR syntax.  Note that file name \fI\s-1FMT\s0\fR strings
for all options are based on the original \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR specified from the command
line, not the name of the source file specified by \fB\-srcfile\fR.
.Sp
For example, to copy metadata from \s-1NEF\s0 files to the corresponding \s-1JPG\s0
previews in a directory where other \s-1JPG\s0 images may exist:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    exiftool \-ext nef \-tagsfromfile @ \-srcfile %d%f.jpg dir
.Ve
.Sp
If more than one \fB\-srcfile\fR option is specified, the files are tested in
order and the first existing source file is processed.  If none of the
source files already exist, then exiftool uses the first \fB\-srcfile\fR
specified.
.Sp
A \fI\s-1FMT\s0\fR of \f(CW\*(C`@\*(C'\fR may be used to represent the original \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR, which may be
useful when specifying multiple \fB\-srcfile\fR options (eg. to fall back to
processing the original \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR if no sidecar exists).
.Sp
When this option is used, two special UserParam tags (OriginalFileName and
OriginalDirectory) are generated to allow access to the original \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR
name and directory.
.IP "\fB\-stay_open\fR \fI\s-1FLAG\s0\fR" 5
.IX Item "-stay_open FLAG"
If \fI\s-1FLAG\s0\fR is \f(CW1\fR or \f(CW\*(C`True\*(C'\fR (case insensitive), causes exiftool keep
reading from the \fB\-@\fR \fI\s-1ARGFILE\s0\fR even after reaching the end of file.  This
feature allows calling applications to pre-load exiftool, thus avoiding the
overhead of loading exiftool for each command.  The procedure is as follows:
.Sp
1) Execute \f(CW\*(C`exiftool \-stay_open True \-@ \f(CIARGFILE\f(CW\*(C'\fR, where \fI\s-1ARGFILE\s0\fR is the
name of an existing (possibly empty) argument file or \f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR to pipe arguments
from the standard input.
.Sp
2) Write exiftool command-line arguments to \fI\s-1ARGFILE\s0\fR, one argument per
line (see the \fB\-@\fR option for details).
.Sp
3) Write \f(CW\*(C`\-execute\en\*(C'\fR to \fI\s-1ARGFILE\s0\fR, where \f(CW\*(C`\en\*(C'\fR represents a newline
sequence.  (Note: You may need to flush your write buffers here if using
buffered output.)  ExifTool will then execute the command with the arguments
received up to this point, send a \*(L"{ready}\*(R" message to stdout when done
(unless the \fB\-q\fR or \fB\-T\fR option is used), and continue trying to read
arguments for the next command from \fI\s-1ARGFILE\s0\fR.  To aid in command/response
synchronization, any number appended to the \fB\-execute\fR option is echoed in
the \*(L"{ready}\*(R" message.  For example, \f(CW\*(C`\-execute613\*(C'\fR results in \*(L"{ready613}\*(R". 
When this number is added, \fB\-q\fR no longer suppresses the \*(L"{ready}\*(R" message.
(Also, see the \fB\-echo3\fR and \fB\-echo4\fR options for additional ways to pass
signals back to your application.)
.Sp
4) Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each command.
.Sp
5) Write \f(CW\*(C`\-stay_open\enFalse\en\*(C'\fR (or \f(CW\*(C`\-stay_open\en0\en\*(C'\fR) to \fI\s-1ARGFILE\s0\fR when
done.  This will cause exiftool to process any remaining command-line
arguments then exit normally.
.Sp
The input \fI\s-1ARGFILE\s0\fR may be changed at any time before step 5 above by
writing the following lines to the currently open \fI\s-1ARGFILE\s0\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    \-stay_open
\&    True
\&    \-@
\&    NEWARGFILE
.Ve
.Sp
This causes \fI\s-1ARGFILE\s0\fR to be closed, and \fI\s-1NEWARGFILE\s0\fR to be kept open. 
(Without the \fB\-stay_open\fR here, exiftool would have returned to reading
arguments from \fI\s-1ARGFILE\s0\fR after reaching the end of \fI\s-1NEWARGFILE\s0\fR.)
.Sp
Note:  When writing arguments to a disk file there is a delay of up to 0.01
seconds after writing \f(CW\*(C`\-execute\en\*(C'\fR before exiftool starts processing the
command.  This delay may be avoided by sending a \s-1CONT\s0 signal to the exiftool
process immediately after writing \f(CW\*(C`\-execute\en\*(C'\fR.  (There is no associated
delay when writing arguments via a pipe with \f(CW\*(C`\-@ \-\*(C'\fR, so the signal is not
necessary when using this technique.)
.IP "\fB\-userParam\fR \fIPARAM[[^]=[\s-1VAL\s0]]\fR" 5
.IX Item "-userParam PARAM[[^]=[VAL]]"
Set user parameter.  \fI\s-1PARAM\s0\fR is an arbitrary user parameter name.  This is
an interface to the \s-1API\s0 UserParam option (see the
Image::ExifTool Options documentation), and
provides a method to access user-defined parameters in arguments to the
\&\fB\-if\fR and \fB\-p\fR options as if they were any other tag.  Appending a hash
tag (\f(CW\*(C`#\*(C'\fR) to \fI\s-1PARAM\s0\fR (eg. \f(CW\*(C`\-userParam MyTag#=yes\*(C'\fR) also causes the
parameter to be extracted as a normal tag in the UserParam group.  Similar
to the \fB\-api\fR option, the parameter value is set to 1 if \fI=VAL\fR is
omitted, undef if just \fI\s-1VAL\s0\fR is omitted with \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR, or an empty string if
\&\fI\s-1VAL\s0\fR is omitted with \f(CW\*(C`^=\*(C'\fR.

\fIAdvanced formatting feature\fR
.IX Subsection "Advanced formatting feature"
.PP
An advanced formatting feature allows modification of the value of any tag
interpolated within a \fB\-if\fR or \fB\-p\fR option argument, or a \fB\-tagsFromFile\fR
redirection string.  Tag names within these strings are prefixed by a \f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR
symbol, and an arbitrary Perl expression may be applied to the tag value by
placing braces around the tag name and inserting the expression after the
name, separated by a semicolon (ie. \f(CW\*(C`${TAG;EXPR}\*(C'\fR).  The expression acts on
the value of the tag through the default input variable (\f(CW$_\fR), and has
access to the full ExifTool \s-1API\s0 through the current ExifTool object
(\f(CW$self\fR) and the tag key (\f(CW$tag\fR).  It may contain any valid Perl code,
including translation (\f(CW\*(C`tr///\*(C'\fR) and substitution (\f(CW\*(C`s///\*(C'\fR) operations, but
note that braces within the expression must be balanced.  The example below
prints the camera Make with spaces translated to underlines, and multiple
consecutive underlines replaced by a single underline:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    exiftool \-p \*(Aq${make;tr/ /_/;s/_\|_+/_/g}\*(Aq image.jpg
.Ve
.PP
An \f(CW\*(C`@\*(C'\fR may be added after the tag name to make the expression act on
individual list items for list-type tags, simplifying list processing.  Set
\&\f(CW$_\fR to undef to remove an item from the list.  As an example, the
following command returns all subjects not containing the string \*(L"xxx\*(R":
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    exiftool \-p \*(Aq${subject@;$_=undef if /xxx/}\*(Aq image.jpg
.Ve
.PP
A default expression of \f(CW\*(C`tr(/\e\e?*:|"<>\e0)()d\*(C'\fR is assumed if the
expression is empty (ie. \f(CW\*(C`${TAG;}\*(C'\fR).  This removes the characters / \e ? * :
| < > and null from the printed value.  (These characters are
illegal in Windows file names, so this feature is useful if tag values are
used in file names.)

\&\f(CW\*(C`DateFmt\*(C'\fR
.PP
Simplifies reformatting of individual date/time values.  This function acts
on a standard EXIF-formatted date/time value in \f(CW$_\fR and formats it
according to the specified format string (see the \fB\-d\fR option).  To avoid
trying to reformat an already-formatted date/time value, a \f(CW\*(C`#\*(C'\fR must be
added to the tag name (as in the example below) if the \fB\-d\fR option is also
used.  For example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    exiftool \-p \*(Aq${createdate#;DateFmt("%Y\-%m\-%d_%H%M%S")}\*(Aq a.jpg
.Ve
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`ShiftTime\*(C'\fR
.PP
Shifts EXIF-formatted date/time string by a specified amount.  Start with a
leading minus sign to shift backwards in time.  See
Image::ExifTool::Shift.pl for details about
shift syntax.  For example, to shift a date/time value back by one year:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    exiftool \-p \*(Aq${createdate;ShiftTime("\-1:0:0 0")}\*(Aq a.jpg
.Ve
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`NoDups\*(C'\fR
.PP
Removes duplicate items from a list with a separator specified by the
\&\fB\-sep\fR option.  This function is most useful when copying list-type tags. 
For example, the following command may be used to remove duplicate Keywords:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    exiftool \-sep \*(Aq##\*(Aq \*(Aq\-keywords<${keywords;NoDups}\*(Aq a.jpg
.Ve
.PP
The \fB\-sep\fR option is necessary to split the string back into individual
list items when writing to a list-type tag.
.PP
An optional flag argument may be set to 1 to cause \f(CW\*(C`NoDups\*(C'\fR to set \f(CW$_\fR to
undef if no duplicates existed, thus preventing the file from being
rewritten unnecessarily:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    exiftool \-sep \*(Aq##\*(Aq \*(Aq\-keywords<${keywords;NoDups(1)}\*(Aq a.jpg
.Ve

.SH "WINDOWS UNICODE FILE NAMES"
.IX Header "WINDOWS UNICODE FILE NAMES"
In Windows, command-line arguments are specified using the current code page
and are recoded automatically to the system code page.  This recoding is not
done for arguments in ExifTool arg files, so by default filenames in arg
files use the system code page.  Unfortunately, these code pages are not
complete character sets, so not all file names may be represented.
.PP
ExifTool 9.79 and later allow the file name encoding to be specified with
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-charset filename=CHARSET\*(C'\fR, where \f(CW\*(C`CHARSET\*(C'\fR is the name of a valid
ExifTool character set, preferably \f(CW\*(C`UTF8\*(C'\fR (see the \fB\-charset\fR option for a
complete list).  Setting this triggers the use of Windows wide-character i/o
routines, thus providing support for most Unicode file names (see note 4). 
But note that it is not trivial to pass properly encoded file names on the
Windows command line (see <https://exiftool.org/faq.html#Q18> for details),
so placing them in a \s-1UTF\-8\s0 encoded \fB\-@\fR argfile and using
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-charset filename=utf8\*(C'\fR is recommended if possible.
.PP
A warning is issued if a specified filename contains special characters and
the filename character set was not provided.  However, the warning may be
disabled by setting \f(CW\*(C`\-charset filename=""\*(C'\fR, and ExifTool may still function
correctly if the system code page matches the character set used for the
file names.
.PP
When a directory name is provided, the file name encoding need not be
specified (unless the directory name contains special characters), and
ExifTool will automatically use wide-character routines to scan the
directory.
.PP
The filename character set applies to the \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR arguments as well as
filename arguments of \fB\-@\fR, \fB\-geotag\fR, \fB\-o\fR, \fB\-p\fR, \fB\-srcfile\fR,
\&\fB\-tagsFromFile\fR, \fB\-csv\fR=, \fB\-j\fR= and \fB\-\fR\fI\s-1TAG\s0\fR<=.  However, it does
not apply to the \fB\-config\fR filename, which always uses the system character
set.  The \f(CW\*(C`\-charset filename=\*(C'\fR option must come before the \fB\-@\fR option to
be effective, but the order doesn't matter with respect to other options.
.PP
Notes:
.PP
1) FileName and Directory tag values still use the same encoding as other
tag values, and are converted to/from the filename character set when
writing/reading if specified.
.PP
2) Unicode support is not yet implemented for other Windows-based systems
like Cygwin.
.PP
3) See \*(L"\s-1WRITING\s0 READ-ONLY \s-1FILES\*(R"\s0 below for a note about editing read-only
files with Unicode names.
.PP
4) Unicode file names with surrogate pairs (code points over U+FFFF) still
cause problems.
.SH "WRITING READ-ONLY FILES"
.IX Header "WRITING READ-ONLY FILES"
In general, ExifTool may be used to write metadata to read-only files
provided that the user has write permission in the directory.  However,
there are three cases where file write permission is also required:
.PP
1) When using the \fB\-overwrite_original_in_place\fR option.
.PP
2) When writing only pseudo System tags (eg. FileModifyDate).
.PP
3) On Windows if the file has Unicode characters in its name, and a) the
\&\fB\-overwrite_original\fR option is used, or b) the \f(CW\*(C`_original\*(C'\fR backup already
exists.
.PP
Hidden files in Windows behave as read-only files when attempting to write
any real tags to the file \*(-- an error is generated when using the

.SH "RENAMING EXAMPLES"
.IX Header "RENAMING EXAMPLES"
By writing the \f(CW\*(C`FileName\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`Directory\*(C'\fR tags, files are renamed and/or
moved to new directories.  This can be particularly useful and powerful for
organizing files by date when combined with the \fB\-d\fR option.  New
directories are created as necessary, but existing files will not be
overwritten.  The format codes \f(CW%d\fR, \f(CW%f\fR and \f(CW%e\fR may be used in the new file
name to represent the directory, name and extension of the original file,
and \f(CW%c\fR may be used to add a copy number if the file already exists (see the
\&\fB\-w\fR option for details).  Note that if used within a date format string,
an extra '%' must be added to pass these codes through the date/time parser.
(And further note that in a Windows batch file, all '%' characters must also
be escaped, so in this extreme case '%%%%f' is necessary to pass a simple
\&'%f' through the two levels of parsing.)  See

examples.

Rename \f(CW\*(C`old.jpg\*(C'\fR to \f(CW\*(C`new.jpg\*(C'\fR in directory \f(CW\*(C`dir\*(C'\fR.
.IP "exiftool \-directory=%e dir" 5
.IX Item "exiftool -directory=%e dir"
Move all files from directory \f(CW\*(C`dir\*(C'\fR into directories named by the original
file extensions.
.ie n .IP "exiftool '\-Directory<DateTimeOriginal' \-d %Y/%m/%d dir" 5
.el .IP "exiftool '\-Directory<DateTimeOriginal' \-d \f(CW%Y\fR/%m/%d dir" 5
.IX Item "exiftool '-Directory<DateTimeOriginal' -d %Y/%m/%d dir"
Move all files in \f(CW\*(C`dir\*(C'\fR into a directory hierarchy based on year, month and
day of \f(CW\*(C`DateTimeOriginal\*(C'\fR.  eg) This command would move the file
\&\f(CW\*(C`dir/image.jpg\*(C'\fR with a \f(CW\*(C`DateTimeOriginal\*(C'\fR of \f(CW\*(C`2005:10:12 16:05:56\*(C'\fR to
\&\f(CW\*(C`2005/10/12/image.jpg\*(C'\fR.
.ie n .IP "exiftool \-o . '\-Directory<DateTimeOriginal' \-d %Y/%m/%d dir" 5
.el .IP "exiftool \-o . '\-Directory<DateTimeOriginal' \-d \f(CW%Y\fR/%m/%d dir" 5
.IX Item "exiftool -o . '-Directory<DateTimeOriginal' -d %Y/%m/%d dir"
Same effect as above except files are copied instead of moved.
.IP "exiftool '\-filename<%f_${model;}.%e' dir" 5
.IX Item "exiftool '-filename<%f_${model;}.%e' dir"
Rename all files in \f(CW\*(C`dir\*(C'\fR by adding the camera model name to the file name.
The semicolon after the tag name inside the braces causes characters which
are invalid in Windows file names to be deleted from the tag value (see the
\&\*(L"Advanced formatting feature\*(R" for an explanation).
.ie n .IP "exiftool '\-FileName<CreateDate' \-d %Y%m%d_%H%M%S%%\-c.%%e dir" 5
.el .IP "exiftool '\-FileName<CreateDate' \-d \f(CW%Y\fR%m%d_%H%M%S%%\-c.%%e dir" 5
.IX Item "exiftool '-FileName<CreateDate' -d %Y%m%d_%H%M%S%%-c.%%e dir"
Rename all images in \f(CW\*(C`dir\*(C'\fR according to the \f(CW\*(C`CreateDate\*(C'\fR date and time,
adding a copy number with leading '\-' if the file already exists (\f(CW\*(C`%\-c\*(C'\fR),
and preserving the original file extension (\f(CW%e\fR).  Note the extra '%'
necessary to escape the filename codes (\f(CW%c\fR and \f(CW%e\fR) in the date format
string.
.ie n .IP "exiftool \-r '\-FileName<CreateDate' \-d %Y\-%m\-%d/%H%M_%%f.%%e dir" 5
.el .IP "exiftool \-r '\-FileName<CreateDate' \-d \f(CW%Y\fR\-%m\-%d/%H%M_%%f.%%e dir" 5
.IX Item "exiftool -r '-FileName<CreateDate' -d %Y-%m-%d/%H%M_%%f.%%e dir"
Both the directory and the filename may be changed together via the
\&\f(CW\*(C`FileName\*(C'\fR tag if the new \f(CW\*(C`FileName\*(C'\fR contains a '/'.  The example above
recursively renames all images in a directory by adding a \f(CW\*(C`CreateDate\*(C'\fR
timestamp to the start of the filename, then moves them into new directories
named by date.
.ie n .IP "exiftool '\-FileName<${CreateDate}_$filenumber.jpg' \-d %Y%m%d \-ext jpg ." 5
.el .IP "exiftool '\-FileName<${CreateDate}_$filenumber.jpg' \-d \f(CW%Y\fR%m%d \-ext jpg ." 5
.IX Item "exiftool '-FileName<${CreateDate}_$filenumber.jpg' -d %Y%m%d -ext jpg ."
Set the filename of all \s-1JPG\s0 images in the current directory from the
CreateDate and FileNumber tags, in the form \*(L"20060507_118\-1861.jpg\*(R".
.SH "GEOTAGGING EXAMPLES"
.IX Header "GEOTAGGING EXAMPLES"
ExifTool implements geotagging via 3 special tags: Geotag (which for
convenience is also implemented as an exiftool option), Geosync and Geotime.
The examples below highlight some geotagging features.  See
<https://exiftool.org/geotag.html> for additional documentation.
.IP "exiftool \-geotag track.log a.jpg" 5
.IX Item "exiftool -geotag track.log a.jpg"
Geotag an image (\f(CW\*(C`a.jpg\*(C'\fR) from position information in a \s-1GPS\s0 track log
(\f(CW\*(C`track.log\*(C'\fR).  Since the \f(CW\*(C`Geotime\*(C'\fR tag is not specified, the value of
DateTimeOriginal is used for geotagging.  Local system time is assumed
unless DateTimeOriginal contains a timezone.
.IP "exiftool \-geotag t.log \-geotime='2009:04:02 13:41:12\-05:00' a.jpg" 5
.IX Item "exiftool -geotag t.log -geotime='2009:04:02 13:41:12-05:00' a.jpg"
Geotag an image with the \s-1GPS\s0 position for a specific time.
.IP "exiftool \-geotag log.gpx '\-xmp:geotime<createdate' dir" 5
.IX Item "exiftool -geotag log.gpx '-xmp:geotime<createdate' dir"
Geotag all images in directory \f(CW\*(C`dir\*(C'\fR with \s-1XMP\s0 tags instead of \s-1EXIF\s0 tags,
based on the image CreateDate.
.IP "exiftool \-geotag a.log \-geosync=\-20 dir" 5
.IX Item "exiftool -geotag a.log -geosync=-20 dir"
Geotag images in directory \f(CW\*(C`dir\*(C'\fR, accounting for image timestamps which
were 20 seconds ahead of \s-1GPS.\s0
.IP "exiftool \-geotag a.log \-geosync=1.jpg \-geosync=2.jpg dir" 5
.IX Item "exiftool -geotag a.log -geosync=1.jpg -geosync=2.jpg dir"
Geotag images using time synchronization from two previously geotagged images
(1.jpg and 2.jpg), synchronizing the image and \s-1GPS\s0 times using a linear time
drift correction.
.IP "exiftool \-geotag a.log '\-geotime<${createdate}+01:00' dir" 5
.IX Item "exiftool -geotag a.log '-geotime<${createdate}+01:00' dir"
Geotag images in \f(CW\*(C`dir\*(C'\fR using CreateDate with the specified timezone.  If
CreateDate already contained a timezone, then the timezone specified on the
command line is ignored.
.IP "exiftool \-geotag= a.jpg" 5
.IX Item "exiftool -geotag= a.jpg"
Delete \s-1GPS\s0 tags which may have been added by the geotag feature.  Note that
this does not remove all \s-1GPS\s0 tags \*(-- to do this instead use \f(CW\*(C`\-gps:all=\*(C'\fR.
.IP "exiftool \-xmp:geotag= a.jpg" 5
.IX Item "exiftool -xmp:geotag= a.jpg"
Delete \s-1XMP GPS\s0 tags which were added by the geotag feature.
.IP "exiftool \-xmp:geotag=track.log a.jpg" 5
.IX Item "exiftool -xmp:geotag=track.log a.jpg"
Geotag an image with \s-1XMP\s0 tags, using the time from DateTimeOriginal.
.IP "exiftool \-geotag a.log \-geotag b.log \-r dir" 5
.IX Item "exiftool -geotag a.log -geotag b.log -r dir"
Combine multiple track logs and geotag an entire directory tree of images.
.IP "exiftool \-geotag 'tracks/*.log' \-r dir" 5
.IX Item "exiftool -geotag 'tracks/*.log' -r dir"
Read all track logs from the \f(CW\*(C`tracks\*(C'\fR directory.
.IP "exiftool \-p gpx.fmt dir > out.gpx" 5
.IX Item "exiftool -p gpx.fmt dir > out.gpx"
Generate a \s-1GPX\s0 track log from all images in directory \f(CW\*(C`dir\*(C'\fR.  This example
uses the \f(CW\*(C`gpx.fmt\*(C'\fR file included in the full ExifTool distribution package
and assumes that the images in \f(CW\*(C`dir\*(C'\fR have all been previously geotagged.
.SH "PIPING EXAMPLES"
.IX Header "PIPING EXAMPLES"
.IP "cat a.jpg | exiftool \-" 5
.IX Item "cat a.jpg | exiftool -"
Extract information from stdin.
.IP "exiftool image.jpg \-thumbnailimage \-b | exiftool \-" 5
.IX Item "exiftool image.jpg -thumbnailimage -b | exiftool -"
Extract information from an embedded thumbnail image.
.IP "cat a.jpg | exiftool \-iptc:keywords+=fantastic \- > b.jpg" 5
.IX Item "cat a.jpg | exiftool -iptc:keywords+=fantastic - > b.jpg"
Add an \s-1IPTC\s0 keyword in a pipeline, saving output to a new file.
.IP "curl \-s http://a.domain.com/bigfile.jpg | exiftool \-fast \-" 5
.IX Item "curl -s http://a.domain.com/bigfile.jpg | exiftool -fast -"
Extract information from an image over the internet using the cURL utility. 
The \fB\-fast\fR option prevents exiftool from scanning for trailer information,
so only the meta information header is transferred.
.IP "exiftool a.jpg \-thumbnailimage \-b | exiftool \-comment=wow \- | exiftool a.jpg \-thumbnailimage'<=\-'" 5
.IX Item "exiftool a.jpg -thumbnailimage -b | exiftool -comment=wow - | exiftool a.jpg -thumbnailimage'<=-'"
Add a comment to an embedded thumbnail image.  (Why anyone would want to do
this I don't know, but I've included this as an example to illustrate the
flexibility of ExifTool.)
.SH "INTERRUPTING EXIFTOOL"
.IX Header "INTERRUPTING EXIFTOOL"
Interrupting exiftool with a CTRL-C or \s-1SIGINT\s0 will not result in partially
written files or temporary files remaining on the hard disk.  The exiftool
application traps \s-1SIGINT\s0 and defers it until the end of critical processes
if necessary, then does a proper cleanup before exiting.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.IX Header "EXIT STATUS"
The exiftool application exits with a status of 0 on success, or 1 if an
error occurred, or 2 if all files failed the \fB\-if\fR condition (for any of
the commands if \fB\-execute\fR was used).
